<H2 class="h2-research">Annotated Bibliography for Teacher Professional Development - Visual Arts</H2>

<b>Wood, P., Frascina, F., Harris, J. & Harrison, C. (1994). <i>Modern art practices and debates.  Modernism in dispute, Art since the forties</i>.  New Haven & London: Yale University Press.</b>
</p>

<p>
For an interesting, and again academic look at the juxtaposition of modernism and postmodernism in art, this text (pp 237-256) pulls out all the big guns.  From the inception of the word "postmodern" by Leo Steinberg in 1972, we are presented with the ideas of Lyotard, Habermas, Lacan, and Baudrillard. As opposed to Modern art, which instilled a viewer passiveness born from its authoritarian control of aesthetic values, postmoderist painting recognises the role of the spectator and invites imaginative work and critical discourse.  Jameson, as a counterpoint, claimed that postmodernism is the new cultural domain of late capitalism.  This chapter acknowledges the complexity of the issues and offers a schematic breakdown of themes with regard to the ideas disputed in the field of visual arts:<br>
<ul>
	<li>
		postmoderism as a critique of the grounds of difference;
	<li>
		postmoderism as a critique of the myth originality;
	<li>
		postmoderism as a critique of historical narratives.
</ul>
The authors end this section, and indeed the book, with a plea to "learn what we can from history".  They maintain that "we have no strong measures of value which are not furnished by the previous productions of our fellow human beings" (pg. 256).

<P>
<b>Davis, B. Sumara, D. & Luce-Kapler, R. (2000). <i>Engaging minds. Learning and teaching in a complex world</i>. New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum Assoc. Inc.</b>
</p>

<p>
	While not specifically an "arts" book, <i>Engaging Minds</i> is an exciting look at creativity and perception.  It directly challenges the structuralist views in the cognitive approach of Dorn's Mind in art.  Using new perspectives in learning theory (complexity theory, enactivism) these authors offer a variety of interactive exercises that generate a personal exploration of  new ways of thinking about intelligence, creativity and diversity.   Alongside these thought provoking and often entertaining activities, are new perspectives on generic lesson plans, classroom management, assessment, diversity, inclusivity and technology.
</p>

<p>
	It is written for teachers by teacher trainers (Department of Secondary Education, University of Alberta, Canada) and would be a useful and challenging tool for both in-service and preservice teachers, groups or individuals.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Dorn, Charles M. (1999). <i>Mind in art: Cognitive foundations in art education</i>. Florida State University, USA:Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.</b>
</p>

<p>
	This book philosophically supports the view that art teachers need to become the principal change agents in art curriculum reform.  To do so, these educators must be clear about what they want their students to know and be able to do, understand how learning in art effects students' cognitive understandings in other areas of the curriculum, and know how they can make their goals clear to students, parents, and Boards of Trustees. The methodology used acquaints readers with some of the learning situations in which they will be expected to function, offers them various teaching and learning alternatives, and recommends some useful solutions for art curriculum development, student learning and assessment.
</p>
<P>The goal of this text is to explain how higher order thinking skills and problem solving activities function in the act of creative forming and to encourage educators to find a way to use this understanding in their own teaching. The chapter <i>Art learning and its assessment</i>, deals with assessment in quite practical terms. Both authentic assessment identification and the use of rubrics are discussed as foci to the relationship of the content of art, to the teaching of art, to the assessing of art. Although aimed at teachers who are following the Goals 2000 Educate America Act, this section is valuable for any educator interested in developing their own philosophy and practical management of assessment in the visual arts.

	<b>Department of Education (1978). <i>Art In Schools &#8211; The New Zealand Experience</i>. Wellington: School Publications Branch.</b>
</p>

<p>
	This practical book reflects the era in New Zealand art education that was most influenced by the convictions of late Gordon Tovey, a renowned art educator. It highlights two themes; the importance of the link between practising artists and art education, and the importance of M&#257;ori arts and crafts in New Zealand society. This book provides an historical perspective.
</p>


<p>
	<b>Miller, W. (1994). <i>What makes a great artist a great artist? Teaching
notes for primary teachers</i>. Sydney: Ashton Scholastic Pty Limited.</b>
</p>

<p>
	A series of books that focuses on developing both students' art
appreciation and teacher expertise through open-ended discussion and
exploration of paintings.  The series presents six great artists: Monet,
Bruegel, Degas, Raphael, Rembrandt and van Gogh.  The activities, which
can be adjusted to any level,  are designed to draw from the existing
knowledge of the students and then highlight the vocabulary and
techniques used by the artists.  Students are then guided to build up
their knowledge and understanding of art appreciation through discussing
their thoughts and feelings about the works, making comparisons, and
using the techniques themselves to make art works.
</p>

<p>
	<b>MacDonald, R. (1995). <i>Nga korero a nga tamariki.  Art: another
language: approaches to teaching Maori art</i>. Lower Hutt: Lands End
Publishing Ltd.</b>
</p>

<p>
The colourful and dynamic artwork  in this book has been done by primary
level children but the teaching approaches and ideas are suitable for
children up to junior secondary level.  All thirteen lesson plans
include objectives, learning goals, motivation, references (including a
bibliography and glossary at the back), process, materials and a step by
step guide of the lesson structure through to evaluation and student
response.  The author reminds teachers that ideas offered here could be
a catalyst for their own teaching.
</p>

<p>
The sections titled 'Motivation' contain valuable information for the
teacher to become more knowledgeable about M&#257;ori art education and its
kaupapa, or philosophy.  Note this book predates the new curriculum.
</p>


<P><B>Jones, L. S. (1998).<I> Art information and the internet.</i> Arizona: Oryx Press.</b>
 
 
<P>If you are looking for a resource that can help guide your web searches, this book is a comprehensive collection of hundreds of useful and well categorised visual art websites.  Not all sites are current though, so it pays to "dial" them up to see if they exist before adding them to resource lists.  Structurally the book is divided up into three sections: basic information formats, types of websites and how to find them, and information on how to use and supplement web information.
 
<P>Some stand-out sections are: 
<UL>
<LI>	"Online Syllabi" (pp 46-54), where American university professors post their art course syllabi with recommended readings for both interdisciplinary and individual studies.
<LI>	"Studying works of art" (pp 159-179) has hundreds of sites listed for an art history and/or art appreciation resource.  
<LI>	"Resources for non-painting media" (pp 180-200) covers time-based art, printmaking, sculpture, and basically anything that is not paint based.</ul>
