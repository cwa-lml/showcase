<p>Excerpts from forum discussion with Tina Hong (National Coordinator for the Arts &#8211; Dance)<br>
17 July 2002</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b> 
<br>
Kia ora and welcome to the first of our dance forums for Term 3. The focus of our discussions over the term will be the Ministry of Education's new resource <i>Dancing the Long White Cloud.</i> We will be discussing one chapter during each dance forum. </p>

<p>Tina Hong (National Coordinator &#8211; Dance) is our guest online this week and she will be discussing pages 8&#8211;9 of <i>Dancing the Long White Cloud</i> in this forum.</p> 

<p>As part of our first weekly challenge, we are inviting you to search the web for appropriate websites on "Celebrations" and to share your discoveries with others. These websites should support the theme of "Making a Celebration Dance".</p> 

<p><b>Tina Hong:</b> 
<br>
Hello everyone, Tina here! Welcome to the first of the online forums for Term 3 (goodness isn't the year flying by)! It's been a while since we've talked about dance in schools. I'm looking forward to hearing your feedback on the new video resource and also catching up on your latest dance focused work in schools.</p>

<p><b>Carol Langton:</b>
<br>
Welcome, Tina, to another forum and a new term. We teachers appreciate the contributions you make to these discussions and thank you for sharing your expertise. I hope you enjoy the time spent answering questions and making comment. </p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Robert:</b> 
<br>
I'm really enjoying <i>Dancing the Long White Cloud</i> and look forward to hearing the discussions about it. It seems to me that framing appropriate questions is a really important part of helping children progress, whether in dance or any other area. Can you give me advice, or a reference that would be useful in helping me improve my ability, and the children's ability, to ask appropriate questions?</p> 

<p><b>Tina Hong:</b> 
<br>
I can't at the moment think of a particular author/title specific to your needs, Robert, although there is a very good drama text by Saxton and Morgan that talks about techniques for open-ended questions that can elicit a wide range of responses. From a personal point of view, what has always worked for me in dance terms is to ask, "Can you show me how many different ways you can...(for example, make asymmetrical shapes with your body)? Or, "Show me at least three ways ... ", etcetera. Using the phrase "at least" gives an indication of what is required as a minimum and yet provides the challenge for those who want to extend and grow the activity/task to do so. Others of you out there may have some suggestions. </p>

<p><b>Carol Langton:</b> 
<br>
The new resources <i>Dancing the Long White Cloud</i> are of top quality. Both videos &#8211; covering classes of all ages &#8211; are excellent. I was riveted while watching them. So, "Celebrations" to those who put that together, Tina...well done. The booklet has a useful, practical model of assessment for those looking for support (pages 12&#8211;14).</p>

<p><b>Jean:</b> 
<br>
Can you explain what is meant by the three 'S's (Slow, Stop and Support)?</p>

<p><b>Tina Hong:</b> 
<br>
"Slow, Stop, Support" is referred to on page 10 under Safe Dance Practices and also in the Whakapapa/Telling Your Story dance unit (page27). It's essentially about teacher scaffolding: knowing where your students are at and providing the necessary structures and platforms for them to make progress, and achieve in dance, in a safe and secure manner. This encompasses the totality of the teaching/learning environment &#8211; physical, emotional, spiritual and cultural. It means taking time and not rushing to get to an end product. The process is very important, so that dance learning becomes a significant way of knowing, thinking, and feeling for our students. Dance learning ought to be meaningful and connected to our students' lived-lives.</p>

<p><b>Win:</b>
<br>
I am working in a secondary school with students who seem reluctant to express or share what they know about dance. If we were to look towards making a celebration dance what would be a useful starting point for us?</p>

<p><b>Tina Hong:</b> 
<br>
Regardless of the age of your students, I believe that a good starting point for developing some dance ideas around the theme of Celebrations is to engage the students in discussion about what is important in their lives: What are the things that they 'celebrate'? What does it mean to celebrate something or someone? We might, of course, look at some traditional cultural celebrations and the dances that have been developed alongside these (the UC strand here!). We look at the past in order to innovate towards the future, so we might look at celebrations that are relevant to the immediate community and the here and now &#8211; what/who is there in the school or local community to celebrate?</p>

<p>I think it is very much about opening up the idea of 'celebration' and involving the students in asking the questions, doing the research and coming up with the ideas. Our role as teachers is to continue to work alongside our students asking even more questions, gently directing them along the journey and then (of course) helping them to think through options and make wise decisions!</p>

<p><b>Carol Langton:</b>
<br>
I was looking through a few websites regarding Celebrations (as the wee task in Action Arts had asked us to do) and found two that I thought would be useful for establishing contexts within which to celebrate and use dance to celebrate:</p>

<p><b>Wayne Flanagan:</b> 
<br>
I look forward to ideas on how to engage students in dance. </p>

<p><b>Tina Hong:</b> 
<br>
Engaging students in dance &#8211; the possibilities are huge. Remember that what we do in teaching dance is not unlike what we try to do in teaching other curriculum subjects &#8211; although I think there's much more potential in dance to make the whole learning more holistic involving mind, body and spirit. It is about arousing curiosity, sparking interest, setting a challenge, opening the door for imagination.</p> 

<p>We can engage students in dance by, for example: showing them some dance work; asking a dance visitor to come and talk about their experiences and/or show their work; ask some intriguing questions ("Who is the action man movie star who also studied ballet?" &#8211; The Muscle from Brussels himself, Jean Claude Van Damme!).</p>
<p>
Practical dance experiences are, of course, a wonderful way of getting the students started. But these have to be structured (particularly in the initial stages of the dance programme) for success and to enable students to find out what they <i>can</i> do, not what they can't do.  Feeling a 'klutz' is not what dance in schools should be about.</p>


<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Carol Langton:</b> 
<br>
Hello Wayne. Good to have you participating on the forum. Glad you're back safe and sound from California. Your experience at the drama institute (McCallum Theatre Institute) sounds fascinating. I am looking forward to hearing you tell us about it next week.</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b> 
<br>
Yes, a special welcome, Wayne. It is good to see you on the forum this week. I hope that everyone will join us next week on the forum to hear all about your trip and also to discuss learning styles and all the other fascinating info that you heard about in USA We are all looking forward to it.</p>

<p><b>Wayne Flanagan:</b> 
<br>
The trip to the USA was inspirational. When working with dance and aesthetic education, we used a focal dance piece to establish a "line of inquiry". Students do not view the focus work until they have experienced what it is like to try it for themselves. The teacher directs activities based around the line of inquiry. Students create their own questions to find answers to, thus becoming more engaged with the work.</p>

<p>Next week I will be sharing information on how to integrate the arts into classroom curriculums gained from these seminars in the USA.</p>

<p><b>Phil:</b>
<br>
I found this site that could be useful. It explains how Christmas celebrations differ around the world.</p> 

<p><a href="http://www.soon.org.uk/country/christmas.htm" target="_blank">http://www.soon.org.uk/country/christmas.htm</a></p>

<p><b>Carol Langton:</b> 
<br>
I have to leave the forum now but I'd like to celebrate the great feedback that we are getting from teachers who are using the resources and the exemplars in The Arts.</p> 

<p><b>Val Duthie: </b>
<br>
Tina, and all other forum participants. Thank you for joining us today. I suggest that we finish now and pick up the topic again on our next dance forum. Go well everyone... until next time. </p>
