<h2 class="h2-forum">Shape making</h2>

<p><a href="index_e.html">Back to Archived Forum Discussion index</a></p>

<p>Excerpts from forum discussion with Tina Hong (National Coordinator &#8211; Dance)<br>
24 April 2002</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b> 
<br>
Welcome to another dance forum. Tina Hong (National Coordinator &#8211; Dance) is our guest online. Our focus this week will be on "shape making". Suggested background reading to inform this discussion: <i>The Arts in the New Zealand Curriculum,</i> pages 20&#8211;35.</p> 

<p><b>Hemi:</b> 
<br>
I would like to ask three things:</p> 

<ol type="1">
<li>how to manage a whole class of students and still get the quality of making shapes;<br><br>
</li>

<li>how to teach the movement between making shapes &#8211; the links; and<br><br>
</li> 

<li>how to ensure the kids understand how to use a technique like shape-making in a range of dances.</li>
</ol> 

<p><b>Tamara:</b> 
<br>
I am very interested in the topic and have done a bit of exploration with my children on shape &#8211; well I think that is what I was working with, using symmetry and asymmetry shapes. However, once I have got my kids to explore this, I did not know what to do next, how to develop this: they were experimenting on their own and in pairs. Where to next?</p> 

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Tina Hong:</b> 
<br>
Hemi and Tamara, thank your for your questions which I'm going to try and answer in one reply. Firstly, the question about managing <b>shape making</b> with a class of students. There will, of course, be a variety of strategies that you might use, but here are a few for starters.</p> 

<ol type="1">
<li>Divide the class in half and have one half making shapes and the other watching and making responses (it helps if you guide the watching that is "Let's look for shapes that show lots of straight lines and angles". Some close observation/discussion follows and then swap over. You can ask children to go to a shape made by the group who are already up and doing, copy/mirror the shape and this then releases the child who created the shape to sit down. This is a useful transition activity. Once the class has done this a few times, this can also become a class activity. Child 'A' makes a frozen shape while child 'B' moves around in general space (roaming) until they select a shape made by another child that they want to copy/mirror. They then copy/mirror, which releases 'A' to move in general space. 'B' then creates own shape and freezes until released by another 'roamer.'<br><br>
</li>



<li>Work in pairs, taking turns initiating and matching and mirroring shapes.<br><br>
</li> 



<li>Do a version of 'copy me' in which the class copies/mirrors a 'leader'. It's best initially for the teacher to be the leader but then have an individual child leading and then that child nominates another person.<br><br>
</li> 



<li>Do shape making in a circle: this can be done in large class initially and then in two or three groups. For example, going in clockwise direction, one child makes a shape then all copy that shape, next child makes a shape and all copy, etcetera. Secondly, moving on to <b>linking:</b> for each of the above explorations, the teacher or children can select some of the shapes to link together. This can be done using different <b>transitions</b> for example move from a ball-like shape to a wall-like shape <b>smoothly.</b> Can you do this using <b>robotic</b> movement? Can you do this in an explosive way? Another way is to introduce <b>pathways</b> and once you have identified the shapes link them using different pathways, for example can you link you first shape and your second shape with a curving pathway? Third, this is for Tamara (as well as others of course!). You've obviously started well with your work with symmetry and asymmetry (good links also to maths).</li>
</ol>

<p>I hope what I have suggested in my reply also gives you some ideas on how to develop your ideas further. You might also want to explore some themes, for example environmental shapes.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Tamara:</b> 
<br>
I never thought of environmental shapes but that sounds very exciting and full of possibilities. Can you expand more on how we might investigate these?  I can see that the children could copy some but not sure how I might further develop this. In terms of shapes in the environment I know that in Wellington there is a Henry Moore exhibition and some of this work lives outside so to speak, would this be another starting point to explore shape making?</p>

<p><b>Carol Langton:</b> 
<br>
Great thought, Tamara. I have been to that exhibition and thought it was wonderful. I imagine it would provide an excellent learning experience relating to the UC strand. Furthermore, the education officers there do a great job. There are sculptures in public areas all around New Zealand that would provide the same experience.</p>

<p><b>Tina Hong:</b> 
<br>
Yes, using visual arts (2D, 3D and time-based art) as stimuli for dance &#8211; making is a very interesting starting point. There are various 'ways in'. You can work directly from the visual arts work and make a movement response to it: think/talk about the shape, textures, lines and colours of the work and then 'render' it in dance terms. Or you might want to discuss the work from a thematic point of view &#8211; what is the artist conveying? How might you begin with this idea and conceptualise it in dance terms?</p> 

<p><b>Hemi:</b> 
<br>
I like the sound of the word "pathways" &#8211; could you elaborate a bit more, please? And how about the UC strand? Could you talk a bit about UC and dance, especially for Year 6&#8211;8 students?</p>

<p><b>Tina Hong:</b> 
<br>
<b>Pathways</b> refer to either <b>floor pathways</b> (can you skip and make a zigzag pathway on the floor from this side of the room to the other?) or <b>air pathways</b> (same activities as before, done in the air: for example, can you use your elbow and make wavy <b>air pathways</b> moving from little to big?). The UC strand (Understanding Context) actually underpins all that we do in dance. All dance occurs in a <b>context</b> &#8211; who does it, where, why, for what purpose, what is done, how is it done? For the earlier levels (1 and 2) the strand is about exploring and coming to know about dance in the community; in the following levels (3 and 4) it is more about how dance is used for varying purposes in cultures. Level 5 has more of a focus on comparing/contrasting dance from past and present cultures. Throughout this strand (and the same for other strands, too, actually) children should come to appreciate that dance is integral to <b>identity.</b> Dance is a way of expressing who you are, who we are as a nation, and how others express their cultures, beliefs and traditions.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Hemi:</b> 
<br>
These kinds of pathways make me think of the Te Reo Kori that we have done and having the kids make their way across the floor in all kinds of different patterns. When it works well, it is really stunning.</p>

<p><b>Tina Hong:</b> 
<br>
I think that it is very appropriate that we have dance-for-dance-sake learning experiences and also dance-as-a-learning-medium experiences which focus on how dance can enhance/support learning in other essential learning areas. Dance can support traditional literacy and numeracy learning wonderfully well. Have a look at this great text resource (try inter-loaning) called <i>Creative dance for all ages</i> by Anne Green Gilbert and published by American Alliance for Health, Physical Recreation and Dance. ISBN: 0-88314-532-4.</p>

<p><b>Phil:</b> 
<br>
I'm interested in learning styles and have been surfing the web recently. I came across an article by Anne Green Gilbert, Director of Creative Dance Centre. The article was about linking spelling/vocabulary and dance. Here is a part of the article. "Spell vocabulary or spelling words with letters formed using the whole body. Letters can be made on different levels, with varying size and with partners. Act out the meaning of the word with actions or a body shape. Write the words in space using different body parts as a pencil. Emphasize the vowel, silent letter, double letter, etcetera. by making those letters larger than the others. Always say each letter as you form or write it and say the word when you are finished". Have you any comments about this way of working? Also, could you comment on a couple of resources that I have discovered on the L3 exemplar that was mentioned earlier? <i>Creative Dance in Primary Schools: A handbook for Teachers</i> by Jan Bolwell, Jenny Cossey, Liz Oliver, Wairarapa Education Resources Centre (1998); <i>Dance and Drama in the Classroom: As long as it takes the jelly to set:</i> A video resource for teachers in primary and intermediate schools (ACE Centre for Arts). Would they both be useful resources at intermediate school level?</p>

<p><b>Tina Hong:</b> 
<br>
Yes, both resources you mention would be appropriate for your level. They give good coverage of activities across the levels and are good beginning points. You can always adapt the activities to suit your class. Just a word about new resources: the beginning of the newly developed Ministry resources for dance should be in schools in the next month! First off will be the dance videos, programme 1 for years 1&#8211;6 and programme 2 for years 7&#8211;10 and accompanying booklet for teachers. The resource has a wonderful title: <i>Dancing the Long White Cloud.</i> Some of you have obviously also had a look at the draft dance exemplars. I'd urge you to have a look if you haven't already done so (via TKI site).</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b> 
<br>
You will find further information on the book mentioned, on the Arts Online site under: Annotated Bibliography for Teacher Professional Development &#8211; Dance Gilbert, Anne Green (1992) <i>Creative Dance for all ages.</i> VA, USA: The American Alliance for Health, Physical Education, Recreation and Dance. <a href="../research/dance_e.html">http://www.tki.org.nz/r/arts/artspd/research/dance_e.php</a>. It is a very readable text especially for those new to dance. This informative book is full of practical ideas and centres its framework on the elements of dance. Part One deals with organisation and implications for planning. Part Two explores creative approaches to the elements of dance. However, the author clearly argues that creative dance is not just about teaching steps: the study of dance concepts is essential. To this end her philosophy and pedagogy are interwoven throughout. You will find the dance exemplars on the following: <a href="http://www.tki.org.elf.internal.cwa.co.nz/r/assessment/exemplars/arts/dance/index_e.php">http://www.tki.org.nz/r/assessment/exemplars/arts/dance/index_e.php</a></p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b> 
<br>
Thank you Tina for being our guest again this week. We really appreciate how you fit the forum into your over-crowded work schedule. Go well everyone and have a good break tomorrow. Hope to see you next week for another forum.</p>
