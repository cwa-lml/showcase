<p>Excerpts from forum discussion with Catherine Gibbs (Curriculum Facilitator, Ministry of Education)<br>
12 September 2001</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b> 
<br>
Welcome to the Arts Online forum where you can discuss issues relating to the Arts. Our guest this week is Catherine Gibbs, Curriculum Facilitator, Ministry of Education. (See Catherine's biography below). This is your opportunity to share ideas, discuss issues and practicalities with her and, perhaps, to seek new solutions.</p> 

<p><b>Catherine Gibbs:</b>
<br>
I am currently the Arts Curriculum Facilitator. I took on the challenging job at the Ministry of Education when I realised that if I could figure out how to implement the new Arts curriculum via distance education, anything else would be a cinch! As it turned out, this job is hugely challenging because of the apparent requirement to juggle "hundreds of balls in the air" and yet remain optimistic about the final outcome.</p> 

<p>At nineteen I discovered that education was a pathway I could happily immerse myself in for a lifetime. So for the next twenty years I taught in primary schools throughout the country and then found a niche in the arts as a music adviser. After twelve years I needed fresh ideas so, moving on again, I became a lecturer at the University of Waikato. But my desire to work more closely with children and the arts meant another shift so I became an author and creator of multimedia resources for teachers in the arts.</p> 

<p>I have travelled widely which has fed one of my other passions &#8211; landscapes. My urge to continue travelling ceased when I realised that I never wanted to leave Wellington again. The energising landscape here inspires my work in arts education. Other sources of inspiration include watching children at play, and meeting people who are constantly looking for new ways to extend their own unlimited potential.</p>

<p><b>Val:</b>
<br>
Hi, we are a two-teacher school with 46 children. The Board of Trustees employs another teacher for half a day. We have been working together with another small school to attend arts workshops at Dunedin College of Education. We have, between the two schools, covered the four disciplines and we are going to have a sharing time in the holidays.</p>

<p><b>Catherine Gibbs:</b> 
<br>
That sounds very positive. What will you share in the holidays? What seems to be the most challenging aspect for a small school such as yours?</p>

<p><b>Val:</b> 
<br>
I guess the biggest challenge is our multi-level classes. We are going to start the day with a grab-bag activity about the document. Then each staff member is going to share something practical and then link it back to the document. Do you have any ideas for this day?</p>

<p><b>Tracy:</b> 
<br>
We are a 5.7 teacher rural school with about 104 children. We are quite a creative bunch on the whole. Every two years we do a major production that includes the whole school and we nearly always do something "little" at our end of year prize giving. Although we can be creative, we do not really have the expertise on our staff that we would like and we see this as one of the barriers we have to overcome! At the moment we are having major renovations at school so we don't feel like doing much anyway!</p>

<p>I agree with Val. Having multi-levels can be a pain. One way we cope with this is to mix the whole school up and have a whole week when we concentrate on one discipline. We get together each afternoon and do different dances (or art activities etcetera) and change each day so the children get a wide variety of experiences. This term it is Dance week. This time, however, we are not splitting the classes. Each class will learn a folk dance, a M&#257;ori dance, a modern dance and a square dance. On Friday we invite parents along to share these. We have found this works quite well in the past.</p>

<p><b>Val:</b>
<br>
I like your ideas Tracey. What resources have you used for dance?</p>

<p><b>Tracy:</b>
<br>
Well! I think Mavis is going to use the old, old dancing resource (I'm not exactly what it is!); Merrylle is using the <i>Te Reo Kori</i> kit; Robyn is going to use New Age folk dancing; Sue and I are going to use the <i>Sing 200</i> kit. Often we go by the seat of our pants! We need to get some more resources for this.</p>

<p><b>Tracy:</b> 
<br>
Last year we did Cinders (with a twist!) &#8211; a musical. It was cool &#8211; Cinders was a boy etcetera.</p> 

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Catherine Gibbs:</b> 
<br>
Tracy, the renovations will be pretty awful &#8211; no good for listening. Your children will be very creative even if you feel that some of your staff are not. How about using the building renovations as a trigger for some dance and drama work? Maybe this will form the basis of a small presentation.</p>

<p><b>Tracy:</b> 
<br>
I guess we could &#8211; but it would be very loud and noisy! I'm quite happy to teach dance and drama myself as I have done both before. But I think the other teachers feel that they do not have the skills to teach these competently enough for their own satisfaction, so one area I will have to work on, as facilitator, is to build their confidence. I recently bought two of the Spectrum Drama books and they are really good for those unconfident people. It takes you step-by-step through lessons. I have found them really good.</p>

<p>I think a lot of the problem is time. We are all so busy and find it difficult to find the time to sit and wade through lots of music to find the perfect piece.</p>

<p><b>Val:</b> 
<br>
Yes, resources are an issue. The folk dance and new wave stuff is great but I still find it hard to get other music.</p>

<p><b>Catherine Gibbs:</b> 
<br>
There are several new resources that are now available that can cross over with dance and music. One is a new CD of all New Zealand music for dance. Another is called <i>Ears Wide Open</i> available from SOUNZ. It is a music resource with ideas for lessons, and a CD that could be used for dance as well.</p> 

<p>I suggest you keep alert to new resources that are listed in Resource Link. The Ministry is publishing dance and music resources by the end of this year, hopefully. These will be helpful for teachers just starting out with music and dance programmes. The dance resources will come with two videos.</p> 

<p><b>Val:</b> 
<br>
I haven't purchased any of the Spectrum material. I have seen the dance book. The ideas in the book, I believe, are great although I understand the music isn't so good. Anyone else know?</p> 

<p><b>Catherine Gibbs:</b> 
<br>
I hope you are all familiar with the Arts Unwrapped site. This will give teachers who are pushed for time some ideas for units or lessons that will get them going. They are linked to the learning examples in the new curriculum.</p> 

<p><b>Tracy:</b>
<br>
I haven't seen the dance one from Spectrum at all. It's a pity if the music is no good. Perhaps it could be adapted? But then why should we do that? Maybe they need to know that the music is not suitable so they can change it &#8211; then I might buy it!</p> 

<p>Our staff went to an NZEI meeting that had an Arts advisor there. It was great, but one thing I thought was interesting was that we did a "dance" activity that was only walking! I guess it came under the movement heading, but it certainly wasn't my idea of dance!</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Val:</b> 
<br>
How are schools going about the implementation of the curriculum?</p>

<p><b>Catherine Gibbs:</b> 
<br>
Every school is different. There is no one way. One of the most common barriers to tackling the arts curriculum is that teachers feel they don't know enough to teach dance, drama, music and the visual arts. One of the basic principles you all know and can transfer to this situation is to move from the known to the unknown. You cannot know it all. Take small risks. Give over a lot of the problem solving to the children. Focus on one discipline for a while until some things start to make more sense.</p>

<p><b>Tracy:</b>
<br>
We are going pretty well. We've done our development plan, a teacher-needs survey and up-dated our policy. We are also doing weekly tasks to get to know the document better. Our next step is to update the programme of work and that is going to be the tricky one as none of us are quite sure how to spread the four disciplines out through the year. Any ideas?</p>

<p><b>Catherine Gibbs:</b> 
<br>
I suggest that you keep everything going in a maintenance type mode but then give a real push to one of the disciplines at a time. The idea is that by the end of the year you will have covered the four disciplines in a balanced way. But it will be a huge job to get everything ticking over at once. And, yes, some interdisciplinary work will help at the initial stages.</p>

<p><b>Val:</b> 
<br>
We have found there seem to be crossovers between dance and drama. We were told to remember what discipline we were focusing on and ensure we were clear in our outcomes. Easier said than done for someone new to these areas like me.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Kittina:</b>
<br>
I'm from Kaikoura High School. We are a Year 7&#8211;13 school with three part time teachers of the arts and at present no HOD English. Three of the teachers are leaving so next year our lonely music teacher (who at present teaches six and a half hours) will be quite lonely. We are hoping to support her and are requesting increasing the hours she teaches to raise the profile of music at this school. By the way, she is from Scotland.</p>

<p><b>Catherine Gibbs:</b>
 <br>
The problem of shifting staff is a serious one. It is not easy to suggest answers to help get "lift off" in an area like the arts. Are there people with arts skills in your local community you can tap into?</p>

<p><b>Kittina:</b>
<br>
We are inviting an artist into the school at the end of the year for activities week and hoping that our part-time art teacher will return at the end of Term 1. Her position will be advertised along with the principal's and social sciences so you can see we are in a state of flux. At present we are rehearsing the musical <i>How the West was Warped</i> and this will help raise the profile of music and drama particularly to the Board of Trustees who will hopefully give music more classroom time.</p>

<p><b>Catherine Gibbs:</b> 
<br>
Kittina, well done! <i>How the west</i> show is a hoot! I have seen it performed a few times. Now I hope the BOT will support this wholeheartedly and help you attract arts-minded teachers to the school. Scotland you say?</p>

<p><b>Kittina:</b> 
<br>
Scotland, yes &#8211; Dunblain. As regards curriculum, there is some resistance and professional disdain because of the joining of art to drama, dance and music. Again, I think that concentrating on one area to start with is the answer. I would hope that Year 7/8 continues to have an increase in music time, and hopefully drama. Dance is the big problem. Often in a secondary situation, experts are the expected norm. In our situation &#8211; a completely isolated rural high school &#8211; we do not have the hours to employ teachers who are considered to be outside the core subjects or, for that matter, a particular expert in dance etcetera.</p>

<p><b>Catherine Gibbs:</b> 
<br>
Everyone it has been a good exercise today. I have to leave now for another appointment. You are welcome to join us all next week with another guest online. Thanks for your participation.</p>
