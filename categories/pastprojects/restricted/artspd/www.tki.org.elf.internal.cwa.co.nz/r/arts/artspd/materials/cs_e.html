<h2 class="h2-materials">Case Studies</h2>

<p><a href="cs_16/cs16_index_e.html"><strong>Establishing a School of Arts at Tauranga Boys' College</strong></a><br />
This case study forms the basis for a visit by Merryn Dunmill, to Tauranga Boys' College in October 2004, as part of the ongoing work the school was engaged in during their participation in The Arts Online professional development programme. It  investigates the shift at Tauranga Boys' College from single arts departments to the School of Arts and gives other schools undergoing similar reviews some ideas to consider.</p>

<p><a href="cs_15/cs15_index_e.html"><strong>Printmaking &#8211; Makarewa School, Invercargill</strong></a><br />
This case study investigates how a focus on the arts resources enabled the teachers at Makarewa School to plan and implement their visual arts programme. It focuses on a printmaking unit the year 6 class worked on in preparation for a school-wide visual arts exhibition being held in the last week of term 3, 2004.</p> 

<p><a href="cs_14/cs14_index_e.html"><strong>The Arts in Collaboration Through a M&#257;ori Context &#8211; Paihia School</strong></a>
<br />
This case study outlines how the staff at Paihia School put into practice their professional development in the arts. It shows how, over a period of six months, they worked with students on the theme of a local (unwritten) legend about Maikuku, a young girl of the area and used the legend for the content and source of motivation for work in dance, drama, music, and the visual arts, which culminated in a three-day arts intensive. The case study supports the video <em>Paihia School Project</em>, available form the School Support Services.</p>


<p><a href="cs_13/cs13_index_e.html"><b>One teacher's journey &#8211; Hamilton East Primary School</b></a><br>
This case study focuses on the personal and professional journey of one teacher as she embarks implementing drama into her classroom, 
as a direct result of participating in the Waikato Arts Curriculum Contract.
</p>


<p><a href="cs_12/cs12_index_e.html"><b>Painting living creatures &#8211; one Bay of Plenty teacher inspires another</b></a><br>
This case study describes how one teacher's own painting and multimedia unit was adapted and used by another teacher. Both teachers encouraged their students to develop visual arts ideas based on the shape, details, and movement of an animal or insect. Student learning focused on acquiring practical experience of colour mixing, use of space and perspective, and developing and using motifs. To develop their ideas, students concentrated on composition, (particularly of foreground and background), and using overlapping and variably sized motifs to create a sense of movement and depth in the painting.</p>


<p><a href="cs_11/cs11_index_e.html"><b>Ceramics with Niuean patterns &#8211; Brandon Intermediate School</b></a><br>
This case study describes the development of a visual arts ceramics unit within a school-wide "electives'" programme. It outlines the unit's purpose, organisational planning and content, evaluation and reflection.  It also considers the issues of class management, and the ceramic and kiln firing processes.</p>


<p><b><a href="cs_10/cs10_index_e.html">The music suite &#8211; Tauranga Intermediate School</a></b><br>
This case study describes how the Tauranga Intermediate School's music specialist and HoD arts, designed a multi-functional music suite for their students.  Equipped with user-friendly technology, a part-time technician, and good quality musical instruments, the music suite made it possible for all students to learn about music in a more professional and supported environment. Success for the songwriting programme, producing award-winning CDs, has encouraged the students to participate in music on many levels.</p>


<p><b><a href="cs_9/cs9_index_e.html">Whole school drama &#8211; Half Moon Bay</a></b><br>
This "mini" case study describes how the students at Half Moon Bay School, their teacher and the drama adviser, worked together to develop a whole school drama exploring how people react when faced with a controversial issue.  In this case, the issue related to a conflict between a land developer and a "concerned citizens group".  The drama conventions used were "teacher-in-role", students in  a "blanket role", "chorus of movement", "hot seating" and "wall of thought".  This case study lists other ideas that might be developed.</p>

<p><b><a href="cs_8/cs8_index_e.html">Kapa Haka Festival Gala &#8211; Okaiawa 
        Primary School</a></b><br>
        This case study describes how Okaiawa Primary School initiated, organised, 
        and ran a Kapa Haka Festival Gala for schools in the Taranaki region. 
        The festival was embraced by the entire local community and provided new 
        teaching and learning opportunities. This case study outlines purpose 
        and outcomes, the organisation and planning, content and issues, and evaluation 
        and reflection.</p>

<p><b><a href="cs1_index_e.html">Two&#8211;Day Arts Intensive &#8211; King Country School Cluster</a></b><br>
This case study describes how six rural contributing primary schools in the
King Country came together for a 2&#8211;day arts intensive. The students
benefited by broadening their experience in the four arts disciplines, and
the teachers shared their expertise with content and approaches to planning.
The case study outlines the purpose and outcomes, the organisation and planning, content and issues, and evaluation and reflection.</p>

<p><b><a href="cs2_index_e.html">Multidisciplinary drama performance &#8211; Otahuhu College</a></b><br>
This case study describes how the Otahuhu College drama department developed a multicultural and multidisciplinary drama performance based on the M&#257;ori myth about Tamatane. Auckland City Council invited Kerry Lynch (HoD Otahuhu College) and 12 of his students to develop and perform the dramatic work to promote Auckland Day to the people of Guangzhou (Auckland's sister city
in China). The case study outlines the purpose and outcomes, the organisation and planning, content and issues, and evaluation and reflection.</p>

<p><b><a href="cs3_index_e.html">Dance Programme &#8211; Ponsonby Primary School</a></b><br>
This case study describes how Ponsonby Primary School developed a lunchtime
school-wide dance programme for students at years 3 to 6 to meet the needs of
students with mixed ability, including those with special needs. The case
study outlines the purpose and outcomes, the organisation and planning,

The entire programme was embraced by the whole school and provided new teaching and learning opportunities. This case study outlines purpose and outcomes, organisational planning, content and issues, and evaluation and reflection.</p>

<p><b><a href="cs_6/cs6_index_e.html">Visual arts exhibition &#8211; Glenbervie School</a></b><br>
This case study describes how Glenbervie School celebrates their students' visual arts work by organising and holding an exhibition of their work every second year. Students study a range of New Zealand artists as a basis for their work and all students exhibit.  This case study outlines purpose and outcomes, organisational planning, content and issues, and evaluation and reflection.</p>

      <p><b><a href="cs_7/cs7_index_e.html">Music programme &#8211; Belmont Primary School</a></b><br>
        This case study describes how a school wide music programme for years 
        1&#8211;6, has been developed and coordinated by a specialist teacher 
        at Belmont Primary School on Auckland's North Shore. The case study outlines
