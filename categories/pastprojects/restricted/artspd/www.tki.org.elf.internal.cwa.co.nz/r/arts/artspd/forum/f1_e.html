<p>Excerpts from forum discussion with Tina Hong (National Coordinator &#8211; Dance)<br>
3 October 2001</p>

<p>
<b>Val Duthie:</b><br> 
Here are some thoughts and questions from Tina Hong (National Coordinator for Dance) that you may like to respond to. Tina is thinking about our twenty-first century students. She poses the following questions: </p>
<p><ul>
<li>Has technology made entertainment too instantaneous so that the days of the family concert have vanished?</li><br><br> 

<li>How do the arts, and in particular dance, impact on students' lives?</li><br><br> 

<li>Now that we have dance in the curriculum, every child should have the opportunity to learn in, through and about dance.</li><br><br> 

<li>How can we as teachers provide learning experiences that will have meaning and "add-value" to our students' lives?</li><br><br> 

<li>What do your students say to you about their school dance experiences?</li><br><br> </ul></P>

<p><b>Tina Hong: </b><br>
Kia ora and warm greetings to all. I'm Tina Hong and currently the Ministry's National Coordinator for Dance based in Auckland. I have a background in primary and secondary teaching, and for the past ten years have been working in teacher education at the Auckland College of Education. I am now a Principal Lecturer, Centre for the Arts. I was the Project Director (Dance/Drama) for the writing of <i>The Arts in the New Zealand Curriculum</i> document and have also been fortunate to contribute to other dance-related developments such as NZQA dance unit standards, NCEA dance panels, and Creative New Zealand dance committees. </p>

<p>I have been a student of dance since the age of four when I first started ballet classes. Growing up as a youngster, and being the eldest of six children, I recall the times the kids would organise family concerts in the garage. What great fun we had, days spent in happy creativity and sharing &#8211; finding the good sheets becoming "curtains", rehearsing and then finally performing our items for Mum and Dad. It's interesting now to reflect back on it all and to realise how much those experiences contributed to my development as a person and to our family life. I wonder if you have similar home-made performing arts/dance memories? </p>

<p>What's happening in the dance programme in your class and your school? I'd love to hear your stories and your questions. Let's talk!</p> 

<p><b>Bridget: </b><br>
As a sole charge teacher of seven students (ages 5, 6, 7, 7, 9, 10, 11 &#8211; three girls and four boys) music and dance are two areas of need when delivering the arts curriculum. I am comfortable with the other strands, so much so that I've entered the children's works in the Gisborne A & P Show. Apart from singing, I have difficulty delivering music and dance to a wide range of students. (We have done a mini production The Huia in which I thought that the children did briliantly). Call me biased. However, I feel that they should be exposed to more music and dance as I know that there's more to music and dance than just singing and a mini production. 
HELP!!!! Any suggestions?  I'd like a balanced progaramme of all four strands to be timetbled into my weekly programme and I'd also like the children to blow-the-socks off their parents and community at their Christmas show. </p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Tina Hong:</b><br> 
Hi Bridget, great to read of your arts programme so far. I agree wholeheartedly with you about the need to timetable regular sessions over the term. Now as for ideas to blow-the-socks-off-the-parents at the end of the year. How about using the New Zealand version of The Twelve Days of Christmas &#8211; it's an oldie but a goodie, and you can always adapt it to it include more local material and of course from a dance perspective. Use the text and images as stimulus for the four strands.</p> 

<p><b>Bridget:</b><br> 
Thanks Tina, your reply has generated a lot of discussion from one mum ("Hi" says Tui) and our teacher aide ("Hello" says Tricia). 
It has given me some food for thought and ideas are already floating around &#8211; thank you. 
Any further suggestions to simplifying multi-level teaching in Dance? </p>

<p><b>Tina Hong:</b><br> 
Hello to you all, great to get a sense of the wh&#257;nau support! As for the multilevel teaching, if your students have done very little in the way of creative dance then I suspect that they will all be starting at level one, at least initially. The way you can facilitate "multi-levelness" particularly in the DI strand is to present different dance "problems" for the students to "solve".</p>

<p><b>Bridget:</b><br> 
Gosh Tina, Val and Sue, I'm feeling full of self-importance &#8211; being the only one online so far. I guess what I'm after is for someone to wave a magic wand and do all the thinking for me &#8211; and voila!! Here is my awesome balanced arts curiculum programme. However, I know that this is not how it is or even should be, but in response to your question about dance programmes during our production of The Huia the children did the following: they told the story of the Huia and how it eventually became extinct; they dramatised the timeline of the huia and it was set with four scene changes; the scenes were simple yet effective, cartons were rotated to depict the scenes; throughout the scenes the children did the following: haka, poi, line dance, acting out story as told by the narrator.</p>

<p><b>Tina Hong:</b><br>  
Bridget, it seems like you're well under way particularly with giving your students experiences in different dance genre. They could now extend their skills and knowledge in dance by using their own vocabularies to create their own dance works based on their own and group ideas (which you could provide the initial stimuli for). Have you had a look at the TKI site dance exemplars? These might give you a lead and some ways forward.

<p><b>Bridget:</b><br> 
Thanks Tina, just knowing where to start is great. I am such a tall story teller and I do try to let the children have a lot of control over their learning, within reason. I guess between the lot of us (all eight of us!) we should come up with something which they enjoy, which relates to the curriculum, and which has a lasting positive impact on their approach and confidence in dance.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Tina Hong:</b><br>  
YES! Learning and working together, creating and developing dance literacy in a supportive community environment is what it should be all about! Go for it!</p> 

<p><b>Bridget:</b><br> 
I'm looking forward to reading your reply to Val's question.  If there are any teachers in a similar situation to mine, I'd love to hear how you manage the arts at your school, especially in music and dance. I'm no artist but I am able to deliver some programmes in the visual arts which has produced some good end products from the children. With the main emphasis being on the processes involved rather that the outcomes. Though Miss Blow does have to add that the end results are really pretty awesome. But put me in charge of delivering a quality music and dance programme, apart from teaching kapa haka at a novice level only, then I'm a rather sad case. So maybe we could share ideas, units, difficulties.</p> 

<p><b>Tina Hong:</b><br> 
There are some new resources coming out which should help teachers. There are two videos &#8211; one for Years 1-6 and the other for Years 7-10 with teacher notes currently in the final stages of development. They should be out in schools early in 2002 &#8211; so keep an eye out for them! I've seen some of the draft material and it's great stuff &#8211; good ideas, generalist teachers working in different contexts, wonderful visuals. The videos should really go a long way in helping teachers to "unpack" dance in the arts curriculum. </p>
