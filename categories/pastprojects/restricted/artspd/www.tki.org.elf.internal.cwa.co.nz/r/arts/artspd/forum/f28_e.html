<p><a href="index_e.html">Back to Archived Forum Discussion index</a></p>

<p>Excerpts from forum discussion with Merryn Dunmill (National Coordinator for the Arts &#8211; Music)<br>
8 May 2002</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b> 
<br>
Kia ora and welcome to another music forum. The focus this week is "creating an active playing environment". Background reading to inform this discussion is <i>Into Music 1,</i> Chapter 3, "Playing", (pages 31&#8211;45).</p>

<p><b>Carol Langton:</b> 
<br>
I am just looking through the curriculum document and noticing how many learning examples for Level 1 ask the children to listen. Can you explain ways that teachers can teach young children to listen to the characteristics of sound while establishing an "active playing environment"?</p> 

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b> 
<br>
Listening skills are essential in all music activities and focused listening is something that needs to be taught carefully and in relation to all other learning activities, for example composing, playing, analysing and representing.</p> 

<p>As the "sound arts", music requires sophisticated approaches to listening, and <i>Into Music 1</i> offers a wide range of these to get you started. In relation to playing, children need to listen for instruments as they learn to play them: What instrument is that? What do you think it is made of? How might it be being played? Can you make sounds like that on this instrument? etcetera. So, understanding tone colour is critical &#8211; why one instrument sounds different to another.</p> 

<p>Hearing, identifying and discussing purposes and features of those instruments in real music examples is the key! Seeing them performed by visiting artists, other students, on television, and so on, is important and the discussion around how and why these instruments are used in our various societies/cultures is so important to the Understanding Music in Context strand of the document.</p>

<p>We don't talk about music enough or share ideas and develop understandings. When playing instruments, the focused listening takes a new form; listening to self and to others to learn to play in time and in tune, to follow a beat, feel the accent (metre) and to make the whole music experience as good as is possible. When it gets louder, new techniques come to the fore; to play faster greater agility is needed; to hear pitch differences they need to understand high and low and the registers of the instruments they play; and to make different effects, they need to explore all the possible sonorities an instrument can express (same with the voice of course).</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Robert:</b> 
<br>
I have a couple of questions to ask you about this topic.</p> 
<ol type="1">
<li>Why is it important to provide kids with both classroom-made and commercially made instruments?</li>

<li>What do you see as the value of using both tuned and un-tuned instruments for use in class?</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b>
<br>
It's actually best to start playing with the body &#8211; using body percussion to explore sounds and their effects and to feel the beat and rhythm, the tempo and metre, the dynamics and even the tone-colours that the body sounds can create. Fun compositions can be made layering and combining these effects based on the rhythm patterns of words and phrases repeated over and over (ostinato). </p>

<p>Keep it simple. Then transfer these onto un-tuned percussion, as beat and rhythm are tricky enough when starting out playing instruments. After these are mastered, move on to pitched instruments such as glockenspiels, marimbas, xylophones, chimes, boom whackers and keyboards. Start with small range pitch ideas like "soh me" (G to E) and develop the ear by widening the range of playback tunes. Get the children to playback simple short one bar tunes or get them to work out their own for others to play.</p> 

<p>Finally, work on whole tunes such as nursery rhymes. Sometimes giving just the start and letting them work out the rest is a wonderful aural and problem-solving activity. They can even try to notate (write out the letter names).</p> 

<p>Words that use the music alphabet (ABCDEFG) can be fun to play as listening games: for example, work out the word BAG. Give the first letter and see if they can find the rest. This is suitable for level 2/3 children around Years 3 &#8211;6, but hey, don't underestimate those lovely little talented people!</p> 

<p>Homemade instruments offer different sound sources and help students understand how acoustics (sound properties) of the instruments work. By making their own, playing them, composing for them, and hearing "real" commercial instruments of the "type" they have made, they learn how sound is made and can make creative choices about selecting sounds to play.</p>

<p><b>Robert:</b>
<br>
Thanks Merryn &#8211; that's great. I'll try the progression you suggest and I'll also go back and have a look more closely at the acoustics of our class-made instruments against commercially made ones. I've had a look at the Creating Musical Ideas from the Community: on <a href="http://www.tki.org.elf.internal.cwa.co.nz/e/arts/music/music_L2/music_L2_A3_menu.php">http://www.tki.org.nz/e/arts/music/music_L2/music_L2_A3_menu.php</a> and found that useful.</p> 

<p>Also enjoyed the exemplar &#8211; Music Level 1 Reading and Recording; Playing: Interpreting Simple Rhythmic Notations on 
<a href="http://www.tki.org.elf.internal.cwa.co.nz/r/assessment/exemplars/arts/music/rrp_2a_e.html">http://www.tki.org.nz/r/assessment/exemplars/arts/music/rrp_2a_e.html</a></p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b>
<br>
Great to hear people are having a look at exemplars. These are only draft and the sound quality is disappointing due to compression but I am working on many more, and on improving those that are there. Some will be re-filmed to improve a few aspects but the general idea will be the same. They should be very helpful. I am going to get more on to artsonline as professional development ideas too &#8211; especially the filming that is not good enough to be used for exemplars. So, watch this space!</p> 

<p><b>Phil:</b> 
<br>
I've just been having a look at pages 36&#8211;37 on <i>Into Music 1</i> booklet. There is a range of interesting games and starters there. Playing in time to the beat, imitating and repeating simple rhythmic or melodic patterns, improvising, etcetera, would seem to be fundamental skills for making music with instruments at all levels.</p> 

<ol type="1">
<li>Could these starter activities be adapted to meet the needs of older and secondary school students?</li>

<li>Do you think they could they be used at a higher level just as they are?</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b>
<br>
Phil, you are so right. I do these with adults, preschoolers &#8211; all ages! The learning is critical and it is the context that changes, that is, choice of language, approach to the "game" and the music selected. For example, keeping to the beat can be a very funky adolescent learning experience when performed to hip-hop. </p>

<p>Try making a movement for the first beat of the bar. Each student chooses their own beat and then everyone in the circle copies it while a backing tape is playing. Then try changing the beat of the bar &#8211; you call out "2" and the action has to now be performed on beat 2, and so on. Even trickier, is to call say 2 and 4 or 1 and 4, etcetera.</p>

<p>Rhythm playbacks and identifying instruments are the learning activities, and the games simply make it a fun way to learn &#8211; so adapt away. Quite a few secondary teachers are using <i>Into Music 1</i> and adapting it because many of their students come with little experience, sadly. (Or so the kids say!)</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b> 
<br>
I am interested in Phil's question too &#8211; and your response. I can see how the material can be adapted to meet the different contexts as you outlined in your response to Phil. If all teachers are like you, Merryn, they will find the adaptation no trouble at all. They will have endless innovations and make the whole process lots of fun too.</p> 

<p>For some teachers, however, resources that are written directly for their older students would be welcomed. We have around 16 Colleges and Area schools on the contract this year. Are there resources specifically designed for (or maybe in the pipeline) for the older student or for a higher level to support teachers and students to create an active playing environment?</p> 

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b> 
<br>
<i>Into Music 1</i> is the first in a series of four, all of which will be in schools by the end of next year. <i>Into Music 2</i> for Years 4&#8211;6 has been written and is at the publishers. <i>Into Music 3</i> for Years 7&#8211;10 is being written and all these guidelines follow a progressive, sequential format which will be invaluable for all schools. The last book is <i>Planning and Assessing in Music Guidelines</i> and will be published next year to support levels 1&#8211;5 of the curriculum (to Year 11).</p>

<p> There are so many resources out there! <i>Sweet: A Taste of New Zealand Music</i> (CD, CDROM and teacher's book) will be sent free to all secondary schools this month &#8211; Music Month! That is based around levels 4 and 5 and is suited to secondary music programmes, really, but intermediates will get ideas too. There are 18 tracks of contemporary rock music with a range of activities &#8211; some quite advanced, others not &#8211; for teachers and students to really get into our wonderful music scene in Aotearoa New Zealand.</p> 

<p>Another primary resource along these lines is planned for next year, courtesy of the NZ Music Industry Commission and the Ministry of Education.</p>

<p><b>Jean:</b> 
<br>
I am trying to introduce more community input to my classes so that students can see live performance and so that we can use the strengths of the folk that we have here in our school community. How do you see the link between school and community music making being strengthened?</p>


<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b> 
<br>
What a good question. I wrote something earlier about inviting community musicians along to play live. It's such an important experience to see, feel, hear and smell those instruments. To see them performed well and with good technique is ideal. Also, learning to be an audience is something our kids need access to.</p>

<p> I often see children at concerts, their first time seeing an orchestra, and they have no idea how to respond. They get very excited and that's great. They also need to know that they listen then respond by clapping at the end, which may take a wee while. Listening, not talking, being polite and thinking about what they are hearing is so important and such a good life skill for all aspects of community living.</p> 

<p>Bringing the community to school, and vice versa, gives kids access to real music in the real world. They may very well move into the wide range of career options out there now in the arts, and in music in particular. (There are so many instruments and styles: performance, composing and arranging; music technology and the whole media industry, performing arts networks, education, etcetera, etcetera). Go for it, you can't fail and it will support your class music programme brilliantly!</p>

<p><b>Carol Langton:</b>
<br>
The schools where I have taught have always included one live professional musical performance per term, either at the school or outside in the community. Whether they had to fundraise or not, they believed it was important for the children to experience live music, to learn to appreciate different kinds of music and to show that music was valued as a way to learn. For the staff, it was always a great day out! We wrote this into our curriculum planning and booked well ahead as you can imagine.</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b> 
<br>
As some instruments are very expensive to buy and others very fragile in construction (not to mention the homemade or class-made variety) they all need careful handling, storage and maintenance.</p> 

<p>How do we encourage students to respect the instruments whether they are commercially bought or student-made? Is this accomplished through knowledge about the instrument (material, construction, cultural background etcetera)?</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b> 
<br>
Good storage, distribution and pack up strategies are essential. When starting a playing activity, students should select and collect one by one and know they can explore their instrument without hurting it; it is taonga and special and they need to be told this before they start.</p> 

<p>Let them carefully try out their instrument, swap with the person next to them. It is important, I think, to start in a circle so that you have eye contact with all students and with their instruments (say, sitting on the floor). Show a signal for stopping, for example, your hands out in front of you like a conductor. Ask that when you do this all instruments stop being played and are placed in front of the student on the floor. Count them in, so that they are always under your (or another student's) direction. This is how real music groups work in all styles of music, conductor or not. There is always someone who leads, albeit discretely.</p> 

<p>Treating the instrument as you would a friend is good: love it. Especially if they have made it: name it, cherish it. In secondary schools, students are often told they can pay for any wilful damage! Accidents can happen though.</p> 

<p>Sometimes I like to distribute and pack up instruments to music. Play to the beat and pass the instruments around the circle into a pile until they are all collected. Walking to the storage space playing to the beat and carefully placing them in organised containers (for example, all wood in one plastic container, all metal in another, all drums in another, all tuned on shelves, covers over keyboards after turning off) is effective too.</p> 

<p>There are no music education problems, only classroom management ones and music can be a great area to learn all the essential skills. Good music teachers are often the best teachers due to management ability of sound equipment, instruments, people, creative energies, and opinions all in one go. It is <i>the most</i> cooperative learning a human can experience, as playing music together requires all to be physically, intellectually, and emotionally connected at the same time, and in time!</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b> 
<br>
Well, coming from a visual arts background, I always thought that good art teachers were the best teachers in the world, but seeing your next statement &#8211; here, here!</p> 

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b>
<br>
Ah well, I may be just a little biased here! But it can be very challenging especially when you are trying to keep everyone playing together. On the other hand, once they are doing that, you know that every single person is <i>on task!</i> How many learning experiences can we confidently say that 100% of the class is really on task at the same time? Maybe dancing. Others, I believe, have kids slipping in and out; some kids are often out, and others can sustain around 60&#8211;70% on-task time in any given learning experience. It's actually well researched. Interesting, yes?</p> 

<p>It's only in playing and singing music, though, that I am so confident of full attention, whole-brain learning. The other learning aspects of listening, analysing, creating and representing can't be monitored so clearly in terms of being on-task!</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Carol Langton:</b> 
<br>
I couldn't agree with you more, Merryn, about music being a 100% focus. As a member of a seven-piece band, I have learned to appreciate how totally encompassing making live music for an audience can be. There are special moments when everyone in the band is on the same wavelength, not just playing the notes correctly but playing with feeling, purpose and passion! We look at each other with the recognition that those moments will never be forgotten.</p>

<p><b>Carol Langton:</b> 
<br>
I am interested in developing ideas with Pacific Island music. Do you have any top resources to share in this area?</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b> 
<br>
Learning Media has two singing resources (CDs and books) of wonderful Pacific Island (PI) music available to purchase. One is brand new. Call Learning Media on 04 472 5522 or fax 04 472 6444 to get information on these resources. New PI resources are being produced and hopefully there will be a video of Samoan music done in a karaoke style (a sing along to a backing track with words across screen and lovely visuals of the country to support the meaning).</p> 

<p>There are many wonderful traditional and contemporary CDs of PI music in our music stores &#8211; too vast to name. <i>Te Vaka</i> is but one. Also, the NZ Music Industry Commission has a Pacific Island Music Handbook which tells you all that is happening in the industry around Pacific Island artists. Try <a href="http://www.nzmusic.org.nz/" target="_blank">http://www.nzmusic.org.nz</a>..."It's all good" as Che Fu says.</p>

<p><b>Christine:</b> 
<br>
I, too, think it is important to have live performances. I remember years ago when my daughter happened to see the leader of the orchestra and his wife play violin and piano, she came home and declared that she wanted to play the violin.</p> 

<p>Is this not a way to solve the problem that we have been reading about in the papers of getting young people involved with classical music? Let them experience it, especially when they are young. However, it is important that the artists who come to the schools are vibrant and interesting. How do we find out how good they are? A top musician is not necessarily good with the children. (Oh, yes, the performance by the two artists mentioned above was excellent).</p> 

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b> 
<br>
Yes, the quality of touring groups/artists in the community is important. Creative New Zealand fund really good ones and promotions come to schools by those touring. Also, the New Zealand Society for Music Education offers a coordinator for secondary schools (funded by the Ministry of Education) to get the best people to schools. This is, at present, only a secondary scheme, sadly.</p> 

<p>City Councils also often offer artists to schools, for example PAIS who are based in Christchurch but cover the entire South Island. The artists are all assessed and monitored/evaluated by schools. Maybe highly recommended people could be advertised by schools for schools through community notice boards or artsonline?!</p> 

<p>I agree with you wholeheartedly on the impact on children &#8211; how else do they understand what they hear and make informed yet passionate decisions about pursuing music!</p>

I haven't been displaying scores on the wall as suggested in the handbook. I guess I hadn't thought about it. Can you tell me about how other schools use these, please?</p> 
 
<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b>
<br>
This is an idea I have and to tell the truth I want it to happen but it hasn't much, yet. Please do this and lead the way. The reo/language of music is universal and a wonderful sight to behold in a room. Putting up the students' work on the walls is commonplace but not their actual music creative work. (Yes, the projects are there but that is literacy in context). So let's all do it and bring music alive, make it talk, sing, sound... and play away!</p>

Just a reminder: a warm welcome to everyone to join us on our first bi-lingual forum next week. Rawiri Hindle and Rawiri Toia will be our guests online and the topic will be Ng&#257; Toi &#8211; Toi Puoro (Music).</p> 

<p>In the meantime, we are near the end of the forum. Many, many thanks again Merryn for your wonderfully rich and helpful responses to the many and varied questions that we have asked during the last hour. We look forward to your next visit on the forum. In the meantime we look forward to some great resources coming our way. Go well everyone. Enjoy, explore, make sounds and have fun.</p>
