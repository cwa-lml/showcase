<h2 class="h2-research">What drama can do for literacy</h2>

<p>by <b>Rachel Roper</b>, Massey University College of Education</p>
<br>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Recent research has shown clearly that effective reading and writing needs to be built on a firm language foundation, which involves enjoyment of oral communication skills (speaking, listening, moving and shaping), as well as world knowledge gained from observing and viewing. 
</p>

<p>However, while the latest research into reading skills continues to demonstrate that phonemic awareness is of key importance when it comes to decoding words and developing accurate spelling and writing skills (Nicholson, 1999), further research also indicates a major need for teachers to take into account the social, political, economic and cultural climates within and beyond students' experiences that will enrich meaning and understanding in reading (Luke and Freebody, 1997).
</p>

<h3>How can drama contribute to literacy?</h3>

<p>Educational drama is a learning tool that can be applied at any level to any topic to help comprehension, interpretation and understanding points of view. Those who are literate and versed in drama are able to enjoy discussing the plays they have seen or the books they have read. This is widely regarded as the hallmark of a truly literate person.
</p>

<p>The way we interpret and enquire beyond text has become a major focus of many critics of reading programmes in which the perception is that good reading programmes are phonics based. The effect of this on classroom teaching is that discussion about literature is being replaced by guided phonics-based reading.
</p>

<p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<h3>Integrated curriculum</h3>

<p>In the turmoil of this literacy debate, it has been frustrating at times to witness opportunities missed by schools and individual teachers, often through not knowing that experiences in the arts generally, and in drama particularly, can enrich and enhance any literacy programme. Recently, I saw a school's Annual Plan that cited reading comprehension as its major focus. The curriculum area identified for development was English, rather than drama. This shows there is a serious need for re-education of teachers in learning about literacy and literature.
</p>

<p>My proposal is that an integrated curriculum, which nevertheless still recognises the knowledge and skills within the separate disciplines, can assist students to engage in more learning. 
</p>

<p>Furthermore, literacy is not just about reading text and understanding it. Andy Kempe (2001:18) perhaps best describes how a deeper understanding of text might be achieved: 
</p>

<ul>
<li>Playing with the sounds ascribed to such marks helps in the comprehension of the words they refer to.</li>
<li>Paying attention to what words do to you physically deepens and clarifies their potential meaning.</li>
<li>Working co-operatively to explore the sights and sounds associated with words is intriguing, in that it reveals that their meaning is not closed to alternative interpretations.</li>
<li>Enacting words reinforces their relationship with context and underlines the fact that the marks on a page are incomplete notations of how humans communicate verbally.</li>
<li>Offering children structured constraints within which to work promotes imaginative work, rather than limits prescribed outcomes.</li>	
</ul>

<p>What better way to comprehend text than through drama! It is understandable that the value of drama as a tool for learning more about language, and about human perceptions and relationships, has been lost to many by the pigeon-holing of drama as a discipline locked within the Arts Curriculum. 
</p>

<h3>British recognition of drama</h3>

<p>Neelands (cited in Davison and Moss, 2000) refers to a survey conducted in Britain by the Secondary Heads Association (SHA). The following questions were asked:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Should [drama] be in the National Curriculum?</li>
<li>Is too much attention paid to productions to the detriment of educational drama?</li>
<li>How well used is drama as a vehicle for personal development?</li>
<li>Are teachers of drama sufficiently well qualified for the task they face? (SHA 1998, cited p87 Davison and Moss)</li>
</ul>
	
<p>Results of this survey found that schools viewed drama as "a vital alternative to the rigid and technologically based frameworks imposed on other subjects" (ibid p87). There was also very strong support for drama being used across the curriculum, but its status was below other curriculum subjects. 
</p>

<p>(It would be both interesting, and timely, to pose these same questions to primary school principals in New Zealand. Time after time I hear comments from such teachers like: "we need more 'activities' for drama" (as if it were an activity-based subject), or "we have lots of drama in our school productions". 
</p>

<p>Despite these survey results, Neelands (ibid) still sees a "crisis" in drama in the primary education sector because of the strong focus on literacy and numeracy strategies. In New Zealand, I feel that at least we are part way there by having drama visible within the curriculum, but we have a long way to go in proving its status and value, particularly in aiding literacy. 
</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<h3>Need for PD on drama</h3>

<p>In this light, the need for ongoing focussed professional development to dispel the myths surrounding drama in education is crucial. And beyond this is the reaction of 'not another curriculum' that needs to be dispelled in favour of helping teachers understand that drama doesn't need to be an add-on, but a way of knowing more about stories and the human condition.
</p>

<p>A recent study focussing on literacy improvement through the arts by Wilkinson (2000) showed positive changes in:
</p>

<ul>
<li>student motivation; </li>
<li>teacher attitudes;</li>
<li>efficacy of learning through the arts;</li>
<li>ability of the arts to engage ethnically diverse students.</li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-bottom:0px;">One teacher, when commenting on student achievement noted that:</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px; margin-top:0px;">	...we got as far as retelling, changing our ending, and changing a character, but for me the true outcome here is to bring that child to the point where he can create that story to express feeling and to tell it. (Ibid p178)</p>


<h3>Pedagogy</h3>

<p>If we reflect on what Heathcote (cited in Battye, 1999) says about what drama can do for our students, a good place to start might be around the pedagogical model that Cope and Kalantziz (2000) present. In this model, they refer to multi-layered societies in which people must operate within their work, public and personal lives. Within each of these 'societies' there are a multitude of literacies &#8211; in linguistic, audio, spatial, gestural, and visual modes &#8211; that need to be learnt and lived. I believe that many of these can be explored through drama. 
</p>

<p>The New London Group (2000) identify four components of pedagogy that are based on an "assumption that the human mind is embodied, situated and social" (ibid p30). These components are: 
</p>

<ul>
<li>situated practice &#8211; being involved and immersed in a community of learners, some of whom need to be experts;</li>
<li>overt instruction &#8211; scaffolding learning to focus the learner; </li>
<li>critical framing &#8211; involving a growing mastery of practice, control and understanding, so that learners within this component can distance and reframe what they have already learned; </li>
<li>transformed practice &#8211; learning can be reflected upon, juxtaposed and integrated into new contexts. </li>
</ul>

<p>In reading about this form of pedagogy, I am reminded of the work of Boal's 'Theatre of the Oppressed' or 'forum theatre'. In this work, Boal requires the audience to become the "spect-actors". The actors present a scenario that depicts some form of oppression. The audience are invited to take on the role of the protagonist, or to coach the protagonist to behave differently. This type of 'forum theatre' was strongly political, but the essence of the conventions Boal introduced allows audience members to re-frame a situation, drawing on both the performance and their own perceptions and experience, and then re-apply what they have learnt back into in real life.   
</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<h3>Case study: exploring student's viewpoints</h3>

<p>Comber and Nixon (2000), among other case studies, refer to the work of a teacher called Jennifer who had her students share their ideas about texts. She asked students to examine what authors said about various gender roles, and then explore their characters' motivations and viewpoints. 
</p>

<p>In another lesson, Jennifer and her students read <i>Beware of Aunts</i> by Pat Thompson, followed by a discussion about their own experiences with aunts. In transcriptions of this discussion, the students' viewpoints are explored as well as the author's. For example, a student thought that recycling was a good idea, but the author's perspective on recycling was that it was a 'bad' idea because the aunt couldn't recycle things particularly well. 
</p>

<p>Jennifer's work illustrates a way in which students can engage in debate over an issue while developing new forms of inquiry into texts. In this scenario, the literacy lesson becomes a place for discussion, bringing new insights into social practice and justice. This is the model found in the New London Group's (2000) 'critical framing and transformed practice' pedagogy, or Boal's (1979) pedagogy that is more commonly referred to as 'forum theatre'. 
</p>

<p>In reading about the work Jennifer does, I see a parallel to the work in a level 1 drama example titled <a href="http://www.tki.org.elf.internal.cwa.co.nz/e/community/arts/drama/drama_L1/drama_L1_A3_menu.php">Freeze-frame Characters</a> on the Te Kete Ipurangi (TKI) website (Ministry of Education 2002). In this activity, students are first asked to describe grandmothers and then examine a grandmother in a text. Through the use of dramatic conventions such as role-on-the-wall, hot-seating and freeze-framing, students can not only learn to think critically about texts, but also to learn more about the roles they need to play in life (Martello, 2001).
</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<h3>Case study: taking risks</h3>

<p>In another case study, Cecilly O'Neill's planning and teaching cycle was studied in depth by Scheurer (1998). This is a useful reference for understanding how teachers can consider and choose appropriate texts for drama. 
</p>

<p>One lesson shows the importance of identifying the dramatic tensions within a story. When working with the poem <i>The Coming of the Plague</i> by Weldon Kees, O'Neill made a list of tensions within the poem, which included the dilemma of whether to stay or leave, and who to blame. 
</p>

<p>In her teaching model, O'Neill begins by developing trust with her students, is willing to take risks, and trusts herself with the process. The New London's (2000) pedagogical model of 'situated practice' also requires learners to be "secure in taking risks and trusting the guidance of others &#8211; both peers and teachers" (p33). Through the shifting of time, roles, and situations, O'Neill is able to help her learners to not only experience the drama itself, but also to begin making thematic connections to other human conditions.
</p>

<h3>Argument for integration</h3>

<p>Wilhelm and Edmiston (1998) make strong links between drama and literacy. They support the idea that language can only be fully learnt through integration across the <b>whole</b> curriculum. They feel that drama can serve as a way to make learning more authentic. 
</p>

<p>They present an interesting case study about Libby who improved and deepened her understanding of reading through learning to live what she read through drama. Their study is yet another example of how connections can be made, and how drama can highlight missing links in students' comprehension skills.
</p>

<h3>Forms of knowing</h3>

<p>Bruner (cited in Wagner, 1998) theorises three ways in which humans know and interpret the world. These are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>'iconic knowing' &#8211; through symbols;</li>
<li>'enactive knowing' &#8211; through doing;</li>
<li>'symbolic knowing' &#8211; through translation into language.</li>
</ul>

<p>We can see how closely these 'forms of knowing' link into drama and language development. In its simplest form, for example, a photograph, a poem, a phrase, a letter or an object can generate questions. The answers can generate a freeze-frame image to represent an interpretation, and any elements, such as time, role and/or action, can be explored. All these 'acts of doing' can be interpreted and reworked into a deeper understanding of different points of view.
</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<h3>Improving comprehension</h3>

<p>Urquhart (2002) looks closely at reasons why students are failing in their comprehension strategies, particularly in being able to infer. Her deduction is that students need to have lived experiences, and that teachers must develop an openness to children's capacities to genuinely inquire around text and seriously play with ideas within the text. 
</p>

<p>This mirrors what Short (1999) refers to. In her writing about students' engagement with texts, Short introduces a model provided by Halliday (cited in Short, 1999 pp4546). This states that, in order for students to engage with language, they must "learn the language, through the language and about the language". She advocates a balance in reading instruction between guided reading and literature circles. Here, drama can act as a way to extend a text as well as think about text in "more complex ways" (p49). By providing a range of perspectives from, and beyond, a text, and by exploring worlds within texts, students can achieve and 'live' the stories of others. 
</p>

<p>For literacy, drama makes meaning, and extends ideas and meanings through reading, talking, sharing and exploring perspectives. Students can learn to write both in and out of a role, using a wide range of genres, such as writing a letter from a character's point of view, or writing a poem as a reaction to an experience in a story. 
</p>

<h3>Case study: imagined places</h3>

<p>In working with a group of intermediate students recently, I shared the book <i>Would You Rather...</i> by John Burningham (1978). I got the students to imagine the place that they would rather be. They explored the space, and then talked (using the convention of telephone conversations) about their imagined place, describing the things and people they heard, saw, touched, smelt and tasted. From this, I presented a simple model for writing a poem about their imagined place. After the poems were written, they were performed with the conventions of:
</p>

<ul>
<li>chorus of movement;</li>
<li>chorus of voices;</li>
<li>fluid sculptures. </li>
</ul>

<p>The transition through talking, doing, writing, and moving to reflection was smooth. A deeper understanding of what John Burmingham might have been alluding to was discussed during the reflection phase. Overall, using drama helped to make this book experience much richer for the students.
</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<h3>Hot/cool framework</h3>

<p>Bowell and Heap (2001) provide a useful planning framework for teachers &#8211; one that I find particularly good for exploring texts in drama. It asks teachers to think of perspectives or roles in terms of those who are closest (or "in the hottest place") and most distant ("in the coolest place") in a story. 
</p>

<p>For example, who are the 'hottest' characters in the story of Goldilocks? Clearly they are Goldilocks and the Three Bears. Cooling down, we might consider Goldilock's mother, her grandmother, the police, the furniture makers (upset at the bad press), the news media, etc. By using dramatic conventions such as role-on-the-wall, hot-seating, telephone conversations, teacher-in-role, wall of thought and freeze-frame, students will begin to live the lives of those within and beyond the story. Out of these experiences may emerge conventions that dig deeper, such as letter writing (for example, the furniture maker's letter to the editor), and diary writing (for example, Baby Bear's diary entry for the famous day). 
</p>

<h3>Allowing time</h3>

<p>Urquhart (2002) also refers to the importance of "spacious questioning" when dealing with comprehension issues. In drama this also applies. 
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0px;">Saxton and Morgan (1991) refer to the 'seven second rule':</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px; margin-top:0px;">It is often a long process to arrive at a point where students are ready to accept that, without their contributions, the work cannot proceed: that the teacher is prepared to wait for answers because she recognises that questions need to be considered and that thoughtful answers need time for formulation. (p 83) 
</p>

<p>In using drama as a tool, students are able to consider questions and re-position themselves. Wilhelm and Edmiston (1998) and Neelands (2002) identify ways in which students can:
</p>

<ul>
<li>view new perspectives and make connections;</li>
<li>work in a collaborative learning environment;</li>
<li>share ideas, and listen and build on them.</li>
</ul>

<p>By moving into a role, students are able to explore features of communication and the language of others. With the right guidance, drama can motivate students to extend their own research, ask more questions, and arrange information in a way that will enhance their understanding of the human dimension.
</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<h3>Strengthening phonics</h3>

<p style="margin-bottom:0px;">An understanding of phonics can be strengthened by the use of 'whole brain' drama techniques. Blevins (1998) says that:</p>
<p style="margin-left:40px; margin-top:0px;">... without a thorough knowledge of letters and an understanding that words are made up of sounds, children cannot learn to read. There are endless alphabet books, rhyme books and story books which are of very high quality where the children can enjoy and savour sounds and letters through their senses and emotions, as well as appreciate the quality which the sounds of words give to good stories and poems. The beginnings of true literacy lie here.
</p>

<p>By playing with sounds (Kempe, 2001), written work and comprehension can also be improved. For example, exploring the rhyme "Peter Piper picking a peck of pickled peppers", or listening to the popcorn pop as you say phonic rhymes, can make for a very memorable phonics lesson. Not only are students seeing the words, they are physically experiencing them. Such drama techniques can bring fresh life to texts, as well as helping pupils to use their imagination and their expressive skills to interpret texts, and to share them as speakers and actors. 
</p>

<h3>Making learning rewarding</h3>

<p>Drama techniques using 'whole-brain' methods for teaching literacy can make the learning process richly rewarding for pupils and teachers at every level of the education system. How teachers are adapting their understanding of drama as a learning tool for literacy and thereby encouraging students to develop their ideas within and beyond stories, is an area that needs much exploration through research.
