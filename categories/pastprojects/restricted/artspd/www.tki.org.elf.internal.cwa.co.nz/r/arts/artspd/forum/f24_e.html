<p>Excerpts from forum discussion with Peter O'Connor (National Coordinator for the Arts &#8211; Drama)<br>
27 February 2002</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b>
<br>This forum is the first of a series of drama forums. Our special guest on these forums will be Peter O'Connor (National Coordinator for the Arts &#8211; Drama). Peter will be online to discuss teachers in role with you during the forum. </p>

<p>
You can prepare for this forum and get added value from the discussion by looking at the Drama Exemplars level 1 and level 4, 
<a href="http://www.tki.org.elf.internal.cwa.co.nz/r/assessment/exemplars/arts/drama/index_e.html">http://www.tki.org.nz/r/assessment/exemplars/arts/drama/index_e.html</a></p>

<p>
<b>Kura:</b>
<br>We are an area school here in the Hokianga with a total immersion M&#257;ori unit as well as Primary and Secondary syndicates. Approximate 340 students are enrolled from new entrants to 6th form, the majority M&#257;ori. We, as a staff and community, work to inspire learning and educational achievement through an understanding and appreciation of our cultural and environmental heritage. The Arts is an area where natural talent is evident and we want to maximise the opportunity for ongoing learning in the multi-disciplines. </p>

<p>Part of the arts team's brief this year is to provide for a whole-school production. We are inclusive of our language and technology curriculum teams' input to make this a combined focus. We would like some direction as to how we can go about writing a script for a major production for Term 3.</p>

<p>The theme is about partnership, encapsulated by our students joining a waka voyage (haerenga) at the beginning of the year to commemorate the signing of the Treaty at Mangungu, the largest gathering for signatures in 1840. Students have been asked to contribute their writings and the next step is to co-ordinate these. Any ideas? </p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b> <br>
I'm not sure that you would want to script a show. By scripting, I guess you mean writing it out. I would see some real value in each class or grouping of kids taking responsibility for different sections of the work, working with their class room teacher around that and then putting it all together. Devising it, or putting it together by improvising, is a much stronger process and easier than scripting it. </p>
<p>
I would imagine there is a strong possibility for use of traditional and contemporary M&#257;ori and Pakeha art forms, dance and drama, and visual arts and music. There was some neat work done up your way about the two taniwha at the entrance to the harbour. Jan Bolwell at Massey University who is working on the arts contract for dance might be able to help you. Also, you've got the Big Belly Women and Tiaho Theatre Company up there who might want to help out. They're pretty good people. </p>

<p><b>Phil:</b>
<br>I enjoy working in role during our drama activities. I am conscious, too, of the importance of keeping a safe environment during that time. What do you find are the most appropriate ways to establish boundaries when the teacher is in role? </p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b>
<br>I'm not sure what you mean by boundaries. The first boundary or frame that drama happens in is that we all accept that we are making a fictional world but we are still a group of kids with a teacher in a real classroom, and the rules we have for usual classroom management still apply. So in my classroom those rules are clearly spelt out. No put downs, no swearing, no racism, no sexism whatever. We can explore a lot of things within process-drama using teacher in role but some things aren't up for discussion. So, the drama doesn't provide the opportunity for kids to verbally or physically abuse others. </p>
<p>
If the drama is well planned, it provides a focus and a tension that drives the learning that often times lessens the need for direct teacher management. The drama does that for you. </p>
<p>
If by boundaries you're talking about drama process, Dorothy Heathcote suggests the teacher in role has to do some very clear and precise things: One, establish that we are all in a drama together and, two, give a clear task within the drama. By this, she means don't just go in and be in role without that role asking something of the student's role. She also suggests that you give one task at a time. </p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Phil:</b>
<br>Thanks for that. Dorothy Heathcote's suggestions are really useful. Where can I get more information about her work? </p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b>
<br>I have posted somewhere on this site a bibliography and in that, there are some suggested readings. However, I'd recommend her collected writings edited by Cecilly O'Neill. Hutchinson 1984. Also Neelands' <i>Making Sense of Drama</i> and O'Neill's <i>Drama Worlds</i> are really helpful. </p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b>
<br>Here is the link to the drama bibliographies: 
<a href="../research/drama_e.html">http://www.tki.org.nz/r/arts/artspd/research/drama_e.php</a></p>

<p><b>Wendy:</b>
<br>I'm in a small rural school, with kids from a range of ages. Can teacher in role work in this sort of situation? Are there any pitfalls to avoid or strategies that will make this approach work for my kids and me? </p>
<p>
Another question: I heard that props are very useful to establish "in role". Can you help, please? 
</p>
<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b>
<br>Yes props and costumes can be really helpful with teacher in role work, especially with younger kids and when working in this way for the first time. It clearly signals when you are in role and when you are back to being Wendy. I always show the kids the putting on of the role marker. It's really useful to have simple props and costumes for the kids. So if they are vets or doctors, the badge they wear can be really helpful in getting them and you in to role. </p>
<p>
Yes, teacher in role can work with one-on-one work. You can do it like this: "The book this week is <i>Greedy Cat.</i> If I was acting as if I was greedy cat's mother, could you be the vet and tell me what I should do? I'll just go over here and put this scarf on. When I do, I'll be the cat's owner and you'll be the vet. Shall we give it a go?"</p>

<p>You only need to do that a few times for the kids to get the idea and want to play with it. In <i>Greedy Cat</i> you could play all sorts of roles including a friend of greedy cat's, or the dog who lives next door; or a dietician coming to help sort out his food; or greedy cat himself complaining about his owner to his friends. </p>
<p>
The TKI Unwrapping the Arts site will soon have a whole teacher in role section showing a teacher doing all this work. Negotiate the drama first and then leap in with the kids. <br>
Little and short to start is my advice for starting teacher in role. </p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Joan:</b> <br>
I am from a tiny secondary school in Taranaki &#8211; only 120 students. Can you give us ideas as to how make drama available to our students when we don't have a drama teacher and our staff is not confident working with it?</p>


<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b>
<br>Now there is a big question. I guess the first part you are already undertaking: professional development for your staff. Have a look as a team at the Ministry's Drama video and see what links you can make to that work. The Unwrapping the Arts site will soon have some really wonderful new stuff up to help as well. To me it's all about giving it a go. It was what I did twenty years ago. I fell over a few times the first fifteen years but I reckon I'm getting better at it. Buy the kids into the fact that you're learning how to do it too; it makes it all a little less scary for everyone. 
</p>

<p><b>Leanne:</b>
<br>We are a Year 0&#8211;8 school. Could you please suggest some ways to encourage facial and vocal expression from the children when they are involved in drama? </p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b>
<br>I'm not a fan of exercises to build vocal and facial expression with young kids. It's all about putting it into context. By that I mean I can't see much point in practising facial expressions outside a context. Skills acquisition, which is what you're talking about, occurs best when there is a context in which it happens.</p>

<p>For example, <i>Billy Goat Gruff:</i> telling kids to wander around going "grrrr" seems like a waste of time to me. If they are in role as expert gruffs teaching other gruffs how to "grr" it puts that in to a fictional and real context and gives it all a bit more of a purpose. Research suggests that way helps with acquiring the skill we are talking about. So, in short, those skills need a dramatic context for real learning to happen. </p>

<p><b>Sue:</b>
<br>We are a small, 54 pupil, rural school from Yrs 0&#8211;8. I love doing drama with my class of Years 3&#8211;5, and as a staff we're all reasonably confident in the process of drama and are slowly coming to terms with the document. But we would like to incorporate more whole school time drama sessions. Is this a good idea, or would you suggest that at this stage we keep it small and simple and stick to our own classes first? </p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b>
<br>I say go for it. Working with others is what drama is all about. The jargon is that we are a social art form. Drama provides a chance for kids to celebrate who they are and why not do that at a whole school level if you think you're ready. It sounds great PD for you as a staff. </p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Phil:</b>
<br>It mentions in the <i>Drama in the Classroom</i> resource book, page 10, how the teacher can question the students both while everyone is in role and when they have come out of role. Would it be best to use the same questions in both these scenarios, or is the focus of the questioning different for both?</p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b>
<br>Both really, depending on the context of the role. Take the <i> Greedy Cat</i> example again. <br>
In role, you could ask all sorts of questions like "What should I do? Can you write that down for me so I can remember etcetera?"</p>

<p>Out of role, you can ask questions to help reflect on the drama they have just done: "What did the owner want (checks for understanding)? What sort of owner was that? What facial expressions did she use to show she was concerned? What were the vets like? If you were the vet what might you ask next (a useful question to rehearse the next in role bit)? How might Greedy cat feel about what his owner is saying about him?"</p>

<p>My sense is that teachers when they first start teacher in role work stay in role too long. It's really important to come out and do some work out of role. Remember our action &#8211; reflection cycle in the arts.</p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b>
<br>What teacher in role does more effectively than any other strategy available to the drama teacher is to move the students into the drama quickly and efficiently. Instead of "talking about" something we immediately start talking as if we are there. That's a huge language shift signalled by the teacher using the first person. </p>
<p>
Instead of asking, "What would the cats mother do?" she says, "I need your help..." <br>
The immediacy of that question and the tension it provides gives a different kind of learning experience to the kids.</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b>
<br>Great help. Should we discuss possible questions before we start the work as well, so that the students know what they are looking for? Is that a good idea?</p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b>
<br>Again, it depends. I always think you have to negotiate the beginning of a process drama. But then I have started a process drama by coming in and sitting down and saying "I won't show you. It was given to me and I promised" then straight out of role and into a series of questions about what they have just done, then back into role and carry it on, building and using what they have given. That's some thing you might do after a few times at this sort of process. </p>
<p>
Other times it's a matter of building more slowly. So you say "We're going to interview Greedy Cat's owner as members of the SPCA, as we are concerned about how Greedy Cat is behaving. What sorts of things might we ask Greedy Cats owner? Practice asking those questions in pairs so that we get a sense of all the kinds of answers she might give to those questions." Using overheard conversations, I can come round and hear them. Then you or they can play the role of Greedy Cat's mum, or you can play the role of the SPCA inspector. Or both.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Sue Cheesman:</b> <br>
Although I realise this is very context-based, if a teacher has had some experience in teacher in role do you have any suggestions for progressions? 
</p>
<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b>
<br>Yes, I think the exemplars show the progression of what we should see happening in the progression of teacher in role work, both for the teacher and the student. </p>
<p>
At level 5, I would expect kids to be able to consciously manipulate that form and use it to take drama into unexpected and exciting creative possibilities. Sanja in the level 1 exemplar shows simply that she can accept the teacher as someone else. Lots of adults can't do this level 1 activity. </p>
<p>
Progression in drama is sometimes about doing the same things but doing them with more sophistication, more conscious control, and an ability to articulate the dramatic choices you have made. The teacher's job in helping kids progress is in structuring learning opportunities so that kids can develop a greater range of choices, with more control and predictability and an ability to say what, and why, they did what they did in the drama.</p>
<p>
<b>Chris: </b>
<br>How long do you suggest being in role in the early stages? </p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b>
<br>Depends on the kids and how much of this they have done before. At first I'd go for minutes and then question out of role and then into role. it will get longer. I stayed in role in a drama I did at Pakuranga College for nearly a term. I dressed as a character called Murphy an 18th century Irishman and stayed in role for the whole time with the entire third form of 300 students.</p>

<p><b>Sue: </b>
<br>Would you suggest that one teacher takes overall responsibility and the other teachers become involved as part of the lesson? And how long and often would you say that we aim for? Once a week for about 30 minutes or fortnightly, remembering that we have all those "other" curriculum areas to teach as well?</p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b>
<br>My suggestion is that drama always has to be about something. That something can always be other curriculum areas. In my thinking, that means you have time to do all your teaching using drama as the way to explore creatively everything. Take as much time as your community and management team will let you get away with. </p>

<p><b>Phil:</b>
<br>Is there anything special that we should look out for when assessing a teacher in role activity? </p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b>
<br>You're going to look for different things at different levels, I guess. The exemplars are the start of tracking that. In the <i>Orphan Train</i> we see someone who challenges the teacher role using a range of dramatic techniques. To achieve it that is very different to what we see at level 1 which is an almost play-like belief in the fictional world without any articulation of what and why she did what she did. We look for that sort of progression when we articulate an assessment of what kids do.</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b>
<br>Peter we send you a virtual bouquet for your flying fingers. It's been a busy hour, but you have provided us with lots to think about and lots to try out in our classrooms. Thank you on behalf of everyone. We look forward to your next forum. </p>
<p>
Thank you, everyone, for participating. We hope you will join us again next week when the dance coordinator will be online.</p>
