<h2 class="h2-forum">Tina's Dance Forum - Wall Charts</h2>

<p><a href="index_e.html">Back to Archived Forum Discussion index</a></p>

<p>Excerpts from forum discussion with Tina Hong (National Co-ordinator, Dance)<br>
9 October 2002</p>

<b>Val Duthie:</b><br>
Kia ora, welcome to Tina's dance forum. The discussion will focus on the wall charts for Classroom Dance Year 1&#8211;10 that have been developed by the Ministry of Education and sent to each school recently. There are two sets of charts aimed at levels 1&#8211;3 and levels 4&#8211;5 of the curriculum document. You will find four charts in each set, each one distinctly aimed at the four strands of the Dance curriculum &#8211; developing practical knowledge, developing ideas in dance, communicating and interpreting in dance, understanding dance in context. See <a href="http://www.tki.org.nz/r/arts/artspd/index_e.php">http://www.tki.org.nz/r/arts/artspd/index_e.php</a> for further information.

<p><i>Has each school received a copy of both sets of charts?</i></p>

<p><b>Wendy:</b><br>
The wall charts are great. They are easy to follow and I like the way that they have been illustrated. There are so many class discussion starters on them. I also like the way that they cover a range of learning styles by using text, then expressive words that illustrate the intention some graphics and then photos of people dancing. </p>

<p><b>Anne:</b><br>
We think they're brilliant. We were so impressed we rang Learning Media and asked for more copies.  They were only able to give us another two copies but we were also able to get one set of the wall charts for Years 7&#8211;10 so they can see where the progressions go to next. The <i>Developing Practical Knowledge Chart 1 Years 1&#8211;6</i> showing dance elements and vocabulary is particularly good. We're getting them all laminated so that they should last longer. </p>

<p><b>Tina Hong:</b><br>
I'm pleased to read your very positive feedback on the dance wall charts. I've had very good responses from around the country. Teachers are liking the big A1 size and the content has appealed to everyone. There has been an 'ask' for smaller sized versions, which are in the pipeline and will be made available in electronic form. I'm currently working on some teacher resource material that will go up online on the TKI dance site that will support what we have on the wall charts &#8211; activities, background information and web site links and such like. Each chart will be able to be downloaded in A4 size for your individual use and schools can then of course enlarge them to A3 size for walls as well. Just a word on the two sets and why all schools were not given both sets &#8211;&#8211; we're trying to keep the Year 1&#8211;6 set separate from the set for Year 7&#8211;10 so that students see these as 'new' charts when they go through to intermediate/secondary school. I realise that this is not quite as easy for full primary and rural schools, but I'm sure you see what the aim is!</p>

<p><b>Bryce:</b><br>
Tina, I see what your intention is here, but like Ann I found it really, really useful to see where the progressions were going. That made it much easier for me as a new teacher of dance to understand what comes next. It would be great if you could continue to develop these resources so that both teachers and students get maximum benefits. I know its probably a matter of dollars.</p>

<p><b>Sue:</b><br>
In my travels I have seen the wall charts displayed and they are so big and visual that you have to notice them and this is great because it means that all that look at them are being exposed to dance vocabulary &#8211; yippee. I noticed the context of that one particularly because I have found that teachers find this the hardest strand to come to terms with.</p>

<p><b>Tina Hong:</b><br>
The intention with the wall charts is, of course, to give dance a physical and visible presence on school walls. As we have said many times before there's a lot of advocacy that needs to be done because very simply, dance in schools (a la curriculum) has not been in the past experience of adults. Whereas most adults and older students know what to pretty much expect in the other curriculum areas (drama is in the same boat as dance!) when it comes to dance, it is pretty much a blank slate. Folk dance is the most common experience but all this dance elements and dance making, dance viewing is pretty much foreign territory. We've got to demystify dance and we hope that the wall charts might help to make some in-roads. So please do have them up in the hall (if you have one) or somewhere else equally prominent so that parents, community members get to see what we're about and what it involves! The really important advocacy however, is in your hands as great teachers &#8211; getting kids excited about dance, learning and asking questions about the subject so that in turn they go home and talk about their learning with Mum and Dad and the whole whanau!</p>

<p><i>How do I get the charts and how do I use them?</i></p>

<p><b>Pamela:</b><br>
Kia ora Tina and everyone. When were the wall charts supposed to have arrived in schools? I haven't received mine yet. Are they for primary or just secondary schools? Can you tell me about them, how can they motivate children and or how you suggest we use them as inspirational starters.</p>

<b>Val Duthie:</b><br>
As I understand it, these wall charts were sent to all schools in September. The entitlement is primary schools &#8211; one set of chart 1 (4 in total), intermediate and secondary schools &#8211; one set of chart 2 (4 in total), full primary schools should have received both sets (8 in total). The wall charts were published by CWA New Media for the Ministry of Education and can be ordered free from:<br>
Learning Media Ltd.<br>

<a href="http://www.learningmedia.co.nz/" target="_blank">http://www.learningmedia.co.nz</a><br>

Years 1&#8211;6, item number 10590<br>  
Years 7&#8211;10, item number 10591.

<p><b>Sue:</b><br>
With regard to the wall charts I have had very positive feedback on them, could you expand on how they might be used as lesson plan starters.</p>

<p><b>Pamela:</b><br>
I am working with the children in my class (yr 4) to plan and make a celebration dance. Can you give me some suggestions about how I could best use the wall charts in this process?</p>

<p><b>Tina Hong:</b><br>
How might you use the CI (chart 3) wall charts? Well, how about using the photos and asking children to talk about the different purposes/cultures/movement/shapes involved in each photo.  What stories are the dances communicating? Do all dances tell stories? Compare the costumes/footwear &#8211; what is different/same?  How does the costume/footwear effect the movement? Can you name/describe some of the different dance genres that are shown? Students might then individually, or in groups, take a particular photo or aspect to research in more detail.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>What music can I use with the charts?</i></p>

<p><b>Linda:</b><br>
Yes like the previous members I think the wall charts are great. I would like some idea of the types of music that can be used with the charts. I have a problem in finding or choosing appropriate music. For example it would be good to have a selection of music, which would accompany chart 4 so the children could appreciate the style of music as well as dance.</p> 

<b>Tina Hong:</b><br>
Sourcing music for dance seems to be an on-going issue. We all have different 'best picks' how about you all contribute a few titles that you've found to be really useful in your dance teaching during this session? As for the question about music for chart 4 &#8211; there are some very good and inexpensive world music compilations that are available from music stores (check your local Warehouse for starters) if you want to purchase or check with the libraries. A good starter for music for creative dance which also includes some cultural rhythms is <i>NZ Music for Creative Dance</i> compiled by Jenny Cossey. This and other music is listed on the TKI Unwrapping the Arts Dance site. Your question has reminded me that we ought to include a section on 'music for dance' in the support material for the charts. Thanks!

<p><b>Sue:</b><br>
In addition to what Tina said I also use a lot of New Zealand music from Te Vaka to ENZo, to Oceania, to Kiwi Nostalgia Hits of the 50s, to Te Ku Te Whe. Also I have found the following to be of use: The Best of Sky, and the Chill Out CDs 1 and 2 and the Moods Series offer many possibilities.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>How can I link the charts with the video 'Dancing the Long White Cloud?</i></p>

<p><b>Bryce:</b><br>
It's good to have several dance resources in school now. Can you give me some suggestions about linking the video 'Dancing the Long White Cloud' to the new wall charts?</p>

<p><b>Tina Hong:</b><br>
The wall charts offer ideas in terms of starting points for classroom dance just like the video material does. In terms of linking, e.g., the video profiles a unit of work that is about 'Celebrations,' you might also look at chart 4 and identify/discuss/research the images that portray different celebrations. There's an image for example of a dragon dance (year 7&#8211;10) and one showing some children dancing at a Cypriot/Greek wedding (Year 1&#8211;6). Year 1&#8211;6 children might also look at the Developing Ideas chart and identify stimuli for dance making based on the theme of 'Celebrations', e.g., the environment, our community, events in our lives. These might be useful starters for group dance work. The wall charts, especially the PK Dance elements and DI (yr 7&#8211;10), should be useful for both teachers and students as teaching aids and readily accessible prompts as you go about exploring various dance vocabulary during practical sessions (PK) and developing skills and knowledge around the creative process of dance making (DI).</p>
