<p><a href="index_e.html">Back to Archived Forum Discussion index</a></p>

<p>Excerpts from forum discussion with Tina Hong (National Coordinator &#8211; Dance)<br>
14 November 2001</p>

<p><b>Tina Hong:</b><br> 
Kia ora everyone. I'm in Wellington today &#8211; lots of liquid sunshine. Lovely to read your questions.</p> 

<p><b>Sue:</b><br> 
At the moment there seem to be a number of TV images and parts of programmes that have movement/dance in them.  How would you suggest we could use these in relation to the curriculum and our programmes?</p>

<p><b>Tina Hong:</b><br> 
First off, I'll make a response to Sue's question about what to do with the TV clips and programmes currently screening. There are some very good programmes, music video clips and even adverts (have you seen the lastest Nike ad?) that show different dance styles, a variety of age-groups, purposes etc demonstrating the diversity of dance. The material all contributes essentially to the UC strand in terms of seeing the purposes/significance of dance. The programmes could be used as starters to get children talking about what they see, why and how dance has been used etc. Also of course useful for initiating dance ideas (DI) and having children responding to dance they view (CI). Using a music video clip students might look at a hip hop clip and, for example, identify the different jumps that are being used before then doing their own explorations about the 5 basic jumps and from there developing there own choreographies &agrave; la hip hop style. As you will gather, dance on television is a rich resource that we can all tap into; the only problem is knowing when the dance programmes or clips will be screening! We're looking at ways in which we might develop an advance warning system for this. The best we can do at the moment is to scan our weekly TV guides and keep a tape handy for recording!</p> 

<p><b>Linda:</b><br> 
Do you have any say in whether dance companies tour New Zealand and whether they would visit Southland? 
I am interested in children seeing and understanding dance as a form of communication. 
Do you think appreciation of dance is as important as performance for children?</p> 

<p><b>Tina Hong:</b><br>
Linda has asked whether I have any say in whether dance companies tour New Zealand and whether they could visit Southland. The short answer is "No" &#8211; companies pretty much do their own thing or do 'the circuit'. I would suggest however that you make contact with Footnote Dance Company who do tend to tour the length and breadth of Aotearoa as much as possible. Footnote are a dance-in-education company who facilitate dance workshops and performances in schools. Their email is: <a href="mailto:footnote@paradise.net.nz">footnote@paradise.net.nz</a> </p>

<p>As for dance appreciation, absolutely this is a big part of the dance curriculum. Developing dance literacy involves not only knowing how to dance in terms of practical skills in doing (PK) and making/choreographing (DI) but also sharing dance and knowing how to talk about dance and how to "read" dance as a visual text (CI). All of this is wrapped in knowing about dance contexts (UC). I know that there is very little in the way of commercially available videos of dance work, but we are working on it! What sort of recorded or live dance work would you be particularly interested in using with your class or school?</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Richard:</b><br> 
How do you see folk dancing fitting into the new scheme?</p> 

<p><b>Tina Hong:</b><br> 
In my experience incorporating folk dance into classroom programmes seems to be the dance form that the majority of teachers feel most comfortable with. Folk dance can continue to be part of PE programme where it has traditionally been "housed" and also "grown" to include more development particularly in terms of the contextual background regarding dance specific outcomes. The dances of a country do much to reveal its people and its culture. Dance as a cultural study is a good starting point for student inquiry and also links well to the social studies curriculum.</p> 

<p><b>Shelley:</b><br> 
Have the old folk dances been transfered onto CDs? 
If so how can we obtain them?</p> 

<p><b>Tina Hong:</b><br> 
As far as I know the folk dance records/tapes have not been put onto CD format. Perhaps this could be something to look at in the future.</p> 

<p><b>Sue:</b><br> 
With reference to folk dance music on CD I think that Rae Storey's revised ones are on CD with the dances being available on video also.</p> 

<p><b>Ann: </b><br>
Interesting reading so far. I work in a remote rural school &#8211; not much opportunity to experience different dance styles, for example, M&#257;ori, Pasifika. How important is it to incorporate these in my programme? If so, how can I go about doing this? What resources are there available that I could use, and how can I access them?</p>

<p><b>Phil: </b><br>
I am particularly interested in hearing about the new resources that are being developed for next year in support of dance.  When are these resources likely to be available to teachers? And will there be online support provided as part of this package?</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Tina Hong: </b><br>
There are several resources currently in the development pipeline. Most advanced are two videos that aim to "unpack" dance in the curriulcum for classroom teachers. Each video is approx 45 minutes long, one is for years 1&#8211;6 and another for years 7&#8211;10. The videos are currently headed towards publication stage and it is anticipated that they will be in schools in the first half of 2002. The videos also have accompanying teachers notes. The videos are intended to be multi-layered and highly interactive and viewed via multiple lenses. Shows several teachers in different contexts and settings teaching/talking/ reflecting on dance. Lots of ideas. All very exciting and I'm sure the videos will be very useful and well received.</p> 

<p>The other project just kicking off are two sets of dance wall charts. Again, a set for years 1&#8211;6 and another set for years 7&#8211;10. The wall charts will focus on each of the four strands of the curriculum and should have lots of stimulating images, help to reinforce dance vocabulary and concepts etc.</p> 

<p>There are a couple of other video projects that are in first phase development: both capture New Zealand dance work, by and for New Zealanders. These will be further developed hopefully in 2002.</p> 

<p>The other biggies &#8211; there are nine new TKI dance examples across levels 1 &#8211; 5 currently being processed to add to the batch already online. These should be online for the start of 2002.</p> 

<p>Then there are national exemplars in dance across levels 1 &#8211; 5. National trials begin in 2002.<br>
<a href="http://www.tki.org.nz/r/assessment/exemplars/index_e.php">http://www.tki.org.nz/r/assessment/exemplars/index_e.php</a></p></P> 

<p><b>Sue:</b><br> 
I know that with appreciation you have mentioned that there is a great deal of dance on the Sydney Olympics opening ceremony video which may provide a good starting point for looking at different dance styles and opening a discussion on understanding context.</p> 

<p><b>Tina Hong:</b> 
It has been good to read and respond to your questions &#8211; time to move on now. Until next time &#8211; keep dancin'!</p>
