<h2 class="h2-implementation">Assessment in the Arts Background</h2>
	
<H3>Introduction</H3>

Assessment is at the heart of a teacher's work and is integral to the process of facilitating 
student development and learning in the arts.  Assessment in the arts is neither purely 
subjective opinion nor extraneous.  Contrary to what some people mistakenly believe &#8211; that you 
can't assess the arts because excellence and quality are merely a matter of subjective 
opinion and that one opinion is as good as another &#8211; assessment in arts education is not 
only possible, it is essential.  Assessment is integral to the creation, performance, 
perception, and contextual understanding of the arts and is an ongoing activity that 
teachers and students, as artists, regularly and systematically do.
<P>
Assessment is an ongoing means of monitoring student progression, providing feedback, 
and identifying the next steps along the learning journey as students develop knowledge, 
skills, and conceptual understandings across the four strands and eight levels of the arts in the New Zealand curriculum.
<P>
Progress in the arts can be identified within the context of the skills, creative processes, 
and conceptual understandings that comprise a student's arts experience.  Students 
develop and make progress across the levels within the four strands of the arts curriculum 
and in various contexts.
<P>
<B>Students do this in dance as they:</B>
<UL>
<LI>extend their personal dance vocabularies and learn the vocabularies of others; 
<LI>choreograph original phrases, sequences, or dances; 
<LI>perform their own and others' dance work;
<LI>view, interpret, and make increasingly informed judgments about dance works;
<LI>investigate the social and cultural contexts of dance genres and styles, both past 
and present.
</UL>

<P>
<B>Students do this in drama as they: </B>
<UL>
<LI>create, develop, and shape roles;
<LI>extend their personal vocabularies of dramatic forms and space; 
<LI>perform their own and others' drama work; 
<LI>respond to, reflect on, and evaluate drama within social, political, and cultural contexts and purposes.
</UL>

<P>
<B>Students do this in music as they: </B>
<UL>
<LI>develop aural skills through identifying and describing sounds; 
<LI>develop technical performance skills through experimentation;
<LI>develop music vocabularies and understandings relating to the elements of music experienced; 
<LI>create through experimenting with sound, improvising and composing music; perform through singing and playing their own and others' music, evaluating and 
interpreting performances; 
<LI>read and write music using a range of notations and available audio, visual, and computer technologies;
<LI>analyse by investigating, identifying, and describing music from a wide range of cultural settings, styles, and genres in past and present contexts.
</UL>

<P>
<B>Students do this in the visual arts as they:</B>
<UL>
<LI>develop practical understanding and skills through the use of visual arts elements, principles,  materials, techniques, processes, and procedures;
<LI>develop visual arts ideas in order to communicate an intention through an art work;
<LI>view and analyse art works in order to understand their meaning and how they 
were made;
<LI>view art works, find out who made them, when, where, for what purpose, and 
how they are or were valued.
</UL>

<H3>Some underlying principles</H3>

Adapted from "Inside the Black Box", Paul Black and Dylan Wiliam. (1998) [<i>Phi Delta Kappan</i>, October, pp 139-44] and <I>Assessment for Learning (Beyond the Black Box)</I>, The Assessment Reference Group (1999), University of Cambridge School of Education.

<P>
<blockquote>Feedback to any pupil should be about the particular qualities of his or her work, with advice on what he or she can do to improve, and should avoid comparisons with other pupils.</blockquote></P>
<P>
<blockquote>For formative assessment to be productive, pupils should be trained in self-
assessment so that they can understand the main purposes of their learning and 
thereby grasp what they need to do to achieve.</blockquote></P>
<P>
<blockquote>Opportunities for pupils to express their understanding should be designed into 
any piece of teaching, for this will initiate the interaction whereby formative 
assessment aids learning.</blockquote></P>
<P>
<blockquote>The dialogue between pupils and a teacher should be thoughtful, reflective, 
focused to evoke and explore understanding, and conducted so that all pupils have an opportunity to think and to express their ideas.</blockquote></P>
<P>
<blockquote>The research indicates that improving learning through assessment depends on 
five, deceptively simple, key factors:
<UL>
<LI>the provision of effective feedback to pupils;
<LI>the active involvement of pupils in their own learning;
<LI>adjusting teaching to take account of the results of assessment;
<LI>a recognition of the profound influence assessment has on the motivation 
and self-esteem of pupils, both of which are crucial influences on learning;
<LI>the need for pupils to be able to assess themselves and understand how to 
improve.
</UL></blockquote></P>

<P>
<blockquote><B>Assessment that promotes learning:</B>
<UL>
<LI>is embedded in a view of teaching and learning of which it is an essential 
part;
<LI>involves sharing learning goals with pupils;
<LI>aims to help pupils to recognise the standards they are aiming for;
<LI>involves pupils in self-assessment;
<LI>provides feedback that leads to pupils recognising their next steps and how 
to take them;
<LI>is underpinned by a confidence that every student can improve;
<LI>involves both teacher and pupils reviewing and reflecting on assessment 
information.
</UL></blockquote></P>

<P>
<blockquote><B>Methods for gaining such information are well rehearsed and are 
essentially:</B>
<UL>
<LI>observing pupils, including listening to how they describe their work and their 
reasoning;
<LI>questioning, using open questions, phrased to invite pupils to explore their 
ideas and reasoning;
<LI>setting tasks in a way that requires pupils to use certain skills or apply 
ideas;
<LI>asking pupils to communicate their thinking through drawings, artefacts, 
actions, role play, concept mapping, as well as writing;
<LI>discussing words and how they are being used.
</UL></blockquote></P>

<P>
<B>OHTs on assessment</B><BR>
For a set of OHTs on assessment in the arts go to <A HREF="../materials/ohts_e.html">OHTs for PD meetings</a> under Teacher PD Materials.  This set of OHTs could be used to focus a workshop session on assessment in the arts.  You could generate your own activities to meet the assessment needs in your school using these as a guide.</P>
