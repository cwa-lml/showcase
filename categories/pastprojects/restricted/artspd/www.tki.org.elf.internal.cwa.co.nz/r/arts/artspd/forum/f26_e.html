<p>Excerpts from forum discussion with Merryn Dunmill (National Coordinator for the Arts &#8211; Music)<br>
5 June 2002</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b>
<br>
Kia ora and welcome to Merryn's music forum on Creating and Representing. For background reading see pages 46 &#8211; 57 of <i>Into Music 1, Classroom Music</i> in Years 1&#8211;3. <br>
</p>
<p>As usual, you are invited to post comments or questions for Merryn, or others participating on the forum before or during the discussion on Wednesday 5 June, 4&#8211;5pm. </p>
<p>
We look forward to 'seeing' you there.</p>

<p><b>JoJo</b><br>
Kia ora koutou, kua tae mai te putiputi purotu o Whangara. He patai taku mo te ra nei. Mihi atu ki a Mr Toia. <br>
Some people assume that Nga Toi is simply a translation of The Arts Curriculum document. What examples would you give to illustrate the fundamental differences between the two documents? For example, Kapa Haka versus Folk dancing? What aspects of the Nga Toi document make the content distinctly Maori? </p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b>
<br>Kia ora koutou. <br>
There are very real differences between the two documents apart from the fact that Nga Toi is not a translation of The Arts document. Nga Toi is based on ihi wehi, wairua and many Maori concepts and approaches. These are unique and special to Maori culture and are not transferable, although it is important to consider them in the pakeha document as well of course. The elements of music and Toi Puoro are similar but contextually different. There are no learning examples as such in the Nga Toi document and these are being developed for kura. The questions are so big that they deserve a forum on their own and there is no time to deal with them respectfully in the time available at the moment. I will pick up on this with Rawiri Toia at a later date if that is ok?</p>

<p><b>Hans:</b>
<br>
Can you explain soundscapes for me? They are mentioned in the chapter referred to above and I'm not too sure about that. What would be a relevant activity for a theme such as "a trip to the zoo"? </p>
<p>
<b>Merryn Dunmill</b>
<br>Soundscapes are just as the title suggests... they are pictorial representations of sound, such as a timeline with graphics or symbols of actual sounds as they are intended to happen in the musical composition. So you could have a trip to the zoo starting at the bus. 10 seconds might be rhythmic bouncing of the engine starting up and accelerating, all shown by real notation, or symbolic ideas. Down the left side is a key which shows which sound sources or instruments play the lines or parts of the score, as in a traditional score. There is a graphic score which is not time based, and a free "events" type score for students to interpret with instruments. These can both be found on the last page of <i>Into Music 1</i> (Appendix 4). Page 49 has clear instructions about what they are and how to interpret and/or write them. </p>
<p>Kids make up their own visuals but they must be clear enough and detailed enough for others to interpret back in the way the music was intended. Going to the zoo is a good one. You can visit cages or areas of different animals; have little themes and melodic ideas for each as in a characterisation. Between each "cage' you could have another little repeating idea such as a rhythmic "hook" to show that you are walking along...</p>

<p><b>Hans:</b>
<br>Thanks, that's great. I now have a clear idea of what that means. I liked your summary &#8211;representing is recording these ideas. That makes sense. Could you also explain 'tone colour' for me?</p>

<p><b>Merryn:</b>
<br>Tone colour is basically why one instrument sounds different to another...exactly as the term says I guess...each instrument or sound has its own unique sound or colour and identifying each on its own and in combination is a great skill. For example, the ability to name a violin playing in a group compared with a piano, or even the different drums in a drum kit, to the differences between a violin and a viola (trickier!). The way the instrument is played impacts on this description too. For example, the violin is plucked, while the guitar is electric and has a distortion effect. </p>

<p><b>Carol Langton:</b>
<br>Kia ora, Merryn. Welcome to another Music Forum. As this one is called "Creating and Representing", could you please define these terms for us? </p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b>
<br>The creating is the ideas as suggested above &#8211; the sounds themselves and how they are selected and organised in relation to the concept. The representation is the written notation of that for future performance...to reproduce. Art is the child of imagination...creating music is composing and improvising, representing is recording those ideas.

<p><b>Chris</b>
<br>Hello, <br>
I'm here. <br>
I have the <i>Into Music</i> CD but can <br>
I find the book.... <br>
I am confounded if I know where it is... <br>
I'm going on a book hunt. <br>
I'm not scared. <br>
I've got a beard. <br>
And when I get into that dark cupboard I'll scare all the dust mites away....</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill</b>
<p>Oh oh! Chris the book hunter...you can always order another from Learning Media, but hey, it'll turn up when you least expect it...Booo!!!! Hope you find it before it finds you.</p>

<p><b>Carol Langton</b>
<br>I have been writing a case study profile for The Arts Online about a school that has a strong song-writing programme. They choose the top songs from the year and make a CD. <br>
I think you should try and write a song using the last paragraph of your message...I'm going on a book hunt, I'm not scared, I have a beard...What fun images!</p>

<p><b>Sue</b>
<br>I too have been unable to find the <i>Into Music</i> book. What does it look like and when was it produced? </p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill</b>
<br>The book <i>Into Music 1,</i> Years 1 &#8211; 3 (and CD inside front cover) was sent end of last year courtesy of Learning Media. You can get more from them. Have a look on Arts Online for what's new because the cover is scanned in for you to see.</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie</b>
<br>For those who don't recognise this book <i>Into Music 1</i> have a look: <a href="../../../../../index_e.html">http://www.tki.org.nz/r/arts/artspd/index_e.php</a>.<br>
You will see a picture of the book on this page. Hope you can then find the actual book in your resource room.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Chris</b>
<br>Singing hi yi yippy yippy yi <br>
Singing hi yi yippy yippy yi <br>
I have conquered that dark cupboard <br>
And the book I have recovered <br>
Singing hi yi yippy yippy yi <br>
Now I'm ready for a soundscape.</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill</b>
<br>That's 2 songs you've coined in one forum...doing well! Carol &#8211; have you heard the Bear Hunt? Sorry but it's already a song so bearware of copyright.</p>

<p><b>Carol</b>
<br>The Bear Hunt.............ah Haa! Yes, I will bearware of copyright. That is actually a major issue...copyright. Can we play CDs in class (we can't play videos)? I know we can't copy CDs, but how about singing the songs off a CD for a school production?</p>

<p><b>Chris</b>
<br>If you are not charging a fee for the video viewing. You are not copying it. It is part of the learning experience. We would never use a video as a time filler after all would we...It can't be a breach of copyright to use the work of a credited artist. Surely...???</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill</b>
<br>Yes, copyright is a big deal. Schools usually pay a sum to APRA for all rights and if no money is changing hands for performance of a song then all is well. There are several fees schools should pay to cover all sorts of copyright and it is worked out on a school capita ratio. If you are just listening in class and singing songs at school for general education purposes it's all fine. Audience-based concerts should detail whom the music is by and technically a fee should be paid. Primary schools generally do not have to worry except when doing musicals and festivals and royalties are incurred from such performances. <br>
Relax in the classroom and don't copy any CDs as with videos. Excerpts of each are fine to use but whole videos, eg of Amadeus, are not supposed to be shown at school. Check your school policy and adherence to all copyright which includes photocopying of written materials of course.</p>

<p><b>Christine</b>
<br>With regard to copyright, I cannot understand the logic of not being able to show a whole video such as Amadeus. It is no longer on the movie circuit, so often the children do not have any access to such cultural materials. Are some of them likely to view it if they went to a video store? I think not. Showing them such videos exposes children to a wide range of experiences that they would not otherwise get. </p>
<p>
<b>Tamara</b>
<br>I have been reading your music ideas on this forum and wondered if you could comment &#8211; are we only talking about sounds made by children or can we use rocks for example, to add to our sound scape?
</p>

<p><b>Jean</b>
<br>I am working with 'identifying and exploring sound' with my class and we are making instruments to experiment with. We have already used material that is the same &#8211; such as all metal, all wood, all plastic. We are next going to combine a range of different materials to find out what sound they will make. Can you give me some guidance on how best to do this as I can see the sounds may be really complex and difficult to distinguish?</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill</b>
<br>
Great that you are making your own instruments and trying a range of sound sources. Excellent science and technology coverage too. Identifying the sounds is a good listening skill. I guess you've done all the "how many different sounds can we make with this instrument?" and "what makes this one sound different to this one?" stuff. Building the vocabulary and the focused listening will help students differentiate when they are all combined. </p>
<p>Try setting up the different materials in groups around the room, for example metal in one corner, wood in the middle and so on. Get a group of students to close their eyes and listen for the different instruments and say which is being played (metal or wood etc). Make this harder by putting students on a range of instruments, made of different materials, in the middle of the room with the rest of the class sitting around the outside of the them, but facing out so they can't see. Tap the shoulder of individual or combined students in the middle, indicating they play their instrument. Get the outside circle to say which instrument/s they heard. </p>
<p>When creating sound pieces, group the instruments in their sounds as independent parts or lines of the score. Have a visual that shows which is which and have students play a line on their instrument. Swap over and play a new line on a new instrument (eg from wood to metal to shakers). Keep the piece short and simple because they are learning to read and interpret sound through playing...quite a complex range of brain and physical things all at once!!! <br>
Hope this makes sense.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Val</b>
<br>This could be a useful link &#8211; The Arts Unwrapped &#8211; L2 "Inventing and Drawing Music" <a href="http://www.tki.org.elf.internal.cwa.co.nz/e/arts/music/music_L2/music_L2_A2_menu.php">http://www.tki.org.nz/e/arts/music/music_L2/music_L2_A2_menu.php</a>.</p>
<p> 
Invent short ideas in music, using a variety of stimuli (e.g., a picture, classroom aquarium). Draw shapes, lines, and patterns to represent these ideas and share them with others. <br>
(DI, CI) </p>

<p><b>Tamara</b>
<br>I think my first question has been answered; however I do have another one. Do you have any ways of encouraging a range of sound in terms of volume? I find that they all want to play loudly. 
</p>
<p><b>Chris</b>
<br>Ask them to play quietly. Two suggestions:</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>Have the children sit in a circle, they play when you touch them on the shoulder, they stop when you touch them again.<br><br>
</li>

<li>Use a ruler or pointer; have the children watch you. When the pointer is down low the volume is low, when you raise it up they play louder. Experiment with up and down to different degrees.</li>
</ol>

<p>Something to start with anyway.</p>

<p><b>Tamara</b>
<br>Thanks Chris. I will try that with all the soundscapes information I have gained. Such great ideas thanks.</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill</b>
<br>Thanks Chris...just the tricks! Get the students to be the conductor sometimes too. Build up texture but keep volume down for a change too...they always get louder and faster when you put more instruments into the mix so try working it the opposite way! Conditioning!!!</p>

<p><b>Tamara</b>
<br>Many thanks, off now.<br>
From bear hunting to soundscaping <br>
will try by and bye. </p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p>
<b>Carol Langton</b>
<br>Merryn, what other Music resources should teachers expect to have had sent to them from Learning Media?</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill</b>
<br>Best to look at the list on their website which I gave last time. They have lots of music resources and new ones just out...too big a list to deal with off the top of my head online sorry. 
</p>
<p><b>Robert</b>
<br>
Kia ora Merryn. I have been a lurker on this forum for quite a while now. You have given me lots of stuff to work on over the weeks, so thanks for all your great ideas. I have really appreciated them. It would be great if you could give me some ideas about how to set up a positive, constructive feedback session with my class.
</p>
<p><b>Merryn Dunmill</b>
<br>Invite the students to comment on what they thought worked well and why. How could they improve their soundscape if they did it again? What did they enjoy and why? What was their favourite moment in the piece? Etc. Get the ideas on a board for class evaluation. Use the language of music &#8211; talk about the dynamics, the tone colours that were particularly effective, how they were made and changed etc. Goal set for another creative adventure...what sounds/graphic ideas could we use in the next piece on...
</p>
<p><b>Christine</b>
<br>I have been reading what others have had to say and have found the comments very useful. A thought crossed my mind. For drama my class of Year 1 &#8211; 3 have been looking at the "Three Billy Goats Gruff." Now that they are so familiar with every aspect of the story, it would be appropriate to do a soundscape of the story. </p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill</b>
<br>The "Three Billy Goats Gruff" could be nicely accompanied by music as a soundscape or completely retold in music minus any words! The music and acting could tell the story, and even just the music on its own if it is powerful enough, well rehearsed with clear musical character ideas so the ear goes, aha! That's the old goat again, there's the trip trop trip trop on the bridge. There's the troll pouncing (as the music gets louder and more excited, faster, more instruments added!!!!) Good luck with it. Enjoy your soundscape.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill</b>
<br>Wondered if any of you have come up with some exciting sources of motivation and creative music teaching ideas (see page 51) that you could share? Eg the trip to the zoo scenario? They need to be based on events/ideas/materials at hand in your community to have the best creative spin off. I'm sure you must have lots of wonderful things happening in your areas that others would like to read about.</p>

<p><b>Sue</b>
<br>I have made a soundscape to a story a child has written by firstly brainstorming the sounds with instruments and recording them in notation form on paper. We then tape recorded the soundscape and used it when reading the story. The children loved it!</p>

<p><b>Carol Langton</b>
<br>A great motivation for sound scapes is Wellington City...or any city for that matter. There are the dull long sad sounds of the ferry horn and then the cruise ships' insistent horn, the click clack of the trains on the railway tracks, the constant rumble of the buses, and the shwishy sound of their doors opening. And above it all the textured sound of the gentle Wellington breeze, blowing the hot sunny air all around, making the autumn leaves flutter!!!!!</p>

<p><b>Jean</b>
<br>When using a piece of music such as "The Hall of the Mountain King" as a model for an exciting ending do you have any advice on how best to use this technique? </p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill</b>
<br>Exciting ways to finish like "Hall of Mountain King"? I think that's what you are asking. Find other pieces that end the same way, in different ways and compare them &#8211; talk about what might be happening. Try to re-create endings of pieces to match ends of stories...happy, sad, mysterious, slow, fast etc. Try doing the opposite for a laugh eg a happy ending or all sad and slow with a little tune that tales off in the air.... 
</p>
<p><b>Val Duthie</b> <br>
I am conscious that we are mostly referring to younger students on this forum. However, we do have a range of area and secondary students also. I have been looking at the teaching examples on page 53 of <i>Into Music 1.</i> If adapted, these would be appropriate for any age of student. Is that right?</p>

<br>Time is almost up...thanks everyone. We could go on for another hour now that we have got going! A good hour of ideas and exchanges. Thank you Merryn...Well done! Go out and Make Music everyone! <br>

<br>Well this has been a wide-ranging discussion. As always, Merryn, you have provided us with lots to think about, lots of suggestions to follow up on and a growing 'fire in the belly about musical education'. Again our thanks. We look forward to your next forum. Go well everyone.</p>

<br>This is my last posting as I am in Auckland on someone else's computer and they want to get home and my flight is in one hour...sorry. Just some ideas to keep you all going. You are doing a great job everyone. Music is education and our students thank you for sharing it with them.</p>
