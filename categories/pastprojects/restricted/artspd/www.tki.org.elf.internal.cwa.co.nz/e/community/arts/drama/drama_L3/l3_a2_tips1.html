      <p><b>Soundscapes</b> </p>
      <p>Soundscapes are useful for evoking a mood and if possible each student should have 
        the opportunity to experience it individually. An audiotape can provide 
        this but a "live" way is to create a soundscape tunnel. Have all those 
        contributing to the sound line up on two sides of the room about a metre 
        apart. Have each person repeat their contributions until they are at the 
        end of the tunnel and then it is their turn to walk through the sound. 
        If there are enough people, being led by the hand blindfolded further 
        enhances the experience.</p>
