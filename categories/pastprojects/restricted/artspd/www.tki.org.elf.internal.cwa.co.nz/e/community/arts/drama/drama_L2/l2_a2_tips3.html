      <p><b>Movement</b> </p>
      <p>Some children can be inhibited when it comes to movement &#8211; one way to 
        work up to it is to start by allowing students to play in the realm of 
        caricature and move towards more realistic or naturalistic roles.</p>
      <p> It is worth working with the children before beginning the drama to 
        assist their conscious manipulation of gestures and facial expressions: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Be very intentional with the shapes and they can be larger and more 
          defined than they might be in real life. </li>
        <li> Tell the students that they may need to hold the position for some 
          time so no standing on one foot or crouching uncomfortably. </li>
        <li> Encourage the children to make interesting shapes &#8211; select students 
          who have produced good work to act as an example for the rest. </li>
        <li> When groups of children are making gestures collectively suggest 
          they think about height, grouping, how they look at each other, where 
          they lean and where their hands are pointing &#8211; how they are in relationship 
          to each other.</li>
      </ul>
