     <p><b>Teacher in Role</b></p>
<ol type="1">
 
<li>Practise this concept with the children by staying in role for a   short time at first &#8211; most children will be well used to this concept from their own play but may not be so familiar with an adult in role. 
<li>Have a prop or costume, at first, that designates when you are in role &#8211; a hat, a talking stick, a scarf &#8211; tell them you will be in role when you are using it and when you put it down you will be back to being their teacher again
<li>Make sure you and the children are clear about your role &#8211; ask them questions either out of role or in role to check they understand.  Have them ask you questions to check they understand and help them to clarify the process.
<li>Have some opening questions worked out
<li>Work out a sign with the children for coming in and out of role and especially for pausing mid action to clarify points and to maintain classroom control.  You can adopt some of the children's own methods <br>
"This is now the ads"
    <br>
"Pause the game for a moment"             
    <br>
The children should have the option of stopping the action (within reason)  
<li>You will need to find different ways of classroom management when you are in role, especially if you adopt a low status role (see 7).  Think about how you will do this..."we had better be really quiet or we may startle the animals"
<li>You do not have to be in role long and beware of having such a good time "playing" with the children that you lose sight of the objectives for going into role.
<li>As a Teacher in role you have a wide range of choice in the status of the role that you select for yourself.  You can be the supreme leader/expert or you can be the lowliest ranking officer. Often a second-in-command role can allow you control but not all the answers and all the authority.  It provides you with a different way of interacting with the children.
<li>If you have adopted a role that is quite harsh or cross and the children have not reacted well or seem frightened come out of role, talk about the role and then go back in again.  Do this rather than avoid using confrontational roles &#8211; these roles will bond the class, united against the threat.
<li>Create a climate where value judgements do not apply.  This may need work beforehand and discussions about value judgements with analogies that the children can relate to.  "What  are the favourite sweets of each member of the class?  Do we think that everyone should like our own favourite sweet best? What are the advantages to different people having different favourite sweets?"
<li>Allow the children their own world of concepts and values. "Pets are every bit as important as people in a family" as well as "you can get a new kitten and you will not be sad that your old cat died"
<li>Value what the students bring and be adaptable enough to move the drama (if necessary) to incorporate their ideas.  This may mean the drama takes a little longer than you anticipated.
<li>Drama often doesn't get you there fast but it will get you there with a richness of understanding and with more depth.
<li>Teacher in role work does not have to be complex &#8211; "Less is more" Margaret Burke
<li>"Drama is not stories re-told, but confrontations between individuals lived at life rate" &#8211; Dorothy Heathcote
