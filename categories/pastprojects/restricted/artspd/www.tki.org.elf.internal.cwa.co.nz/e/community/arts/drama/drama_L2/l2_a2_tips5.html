<li>You do not need to be too technical; the children need to be able to portray something through clear movement.  Help them to work out what is necessary and cut out all other movement.  If you do go into anything technical look at making:
<ul>
<li>a clear focus 
<li>not splitting the focus (having two or more things happening at the same time and the audience doesn't know what to look at)
<li>facial expressions are important
<li>clear sight lines for anyone watching (ie if there is an "audience" turn the action towards them)
<li>make movements big &#8211; exaggerate them
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Condense time &#8211; if a shower would normally take 5 minutes we don't need to see it all &#8211; large washing gestures are what is required.</p>
