She is not particularly assertive, and is not skilled at developing the skills of others. She tends to use systems that work for her and then impose them on others. She also believes it is often better to do things yourself to ensure they are done 'properly'.</p><a name="mike"></a><p><strong>Mike</strong> manages a number of people, and often finds things stressful. He is a fairly distant manager who only gets involved when things go wrong. While he tries to be encouraging of staff, he has had some unpleasant experiences in the past, and often ends up using 'the stick' as a motivational tool with staff.</p><a name="Brendan"></a><p><strong>Brendan</strong> is a fairly new member of the team. He reports to Charlotte. He finished in the top 5 percent of his university year, and feels his talents are being wasted. He's ambitious. His work is generally of a good standard, but he tends to blame others for mistakes. He has not been fully trained yet. He is hoping to take up a 'better' position in another company very soon.</p><a name="moana"></a><p><strong>Moana</strong> reports to Charlotte. She's really happy to have a job in the organization, and generally enjoys the work. She hasn't quite figured out all of the personal dynamics in the workplace, so tries to 'keep out' of any arguments that occur. She hasn't been fully trained yet either, and while she is keen to learn more, she's not quite sure who to ask for advice.</p><a name="colin"></a><p><strong>Colin</strong> has been working in the team for some time, and is very skilled and experienced. He reports to Charlotte. He has very good work record, but is currently trying to deal with a stressful personal situation (his 15 year old daughter is pregnant). He has some 'good mates' in the office, but is reluctant to talk to his team about his family worries - consequently he has become a little withdrawn from them, and his work has suffered.</p><p><a class="sbutton" href="intro.html">&laquo; PREVIOUS</a></p><!-- end transcript text --><br /><br /></td><td><img src="img/spacer.gif" width="18" height="1" alt="" /></td></tr></table><!-- end content table --></td></tr></table></body></html>
