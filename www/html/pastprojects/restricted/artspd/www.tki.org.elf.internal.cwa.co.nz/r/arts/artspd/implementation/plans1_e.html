<h2 class="h2-implementation">What is a Curriculum Delivery Plan?</h2>

      <p> A curriculum delivery plan provides an overview of what, and how, the school 
        curriculum will be delivered. There are many decisions that schools can 
        make at a local level about how to deliver curriculum in order to meet 
        the needs of their students and fulfil the aims and goals of the community. 
        There are however some key points that provide national guidance for schools 
        &#8211; The National Education Guidelines and in particular, The National 
        Administration Guidelines. </p>

	<p>
		 Care must be taken when writing delivery plans to ensure that their real purpose is not to allow "instrumental processes and procedures to become ends in themselves" (Sergiovanni, 1992:15).   The real purpose is to develop a consciousness about quality learning in the school that represents a collaborative approach to consistent practice in meeting national requirements.  A curriculum delivery plan provides a framework for meeting the dynamic and ever changing needs of the student population through the provision of curriculum delivery that is responsive to their learning, yet accountable.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<b>Where does The Arts Curriculum fit in?</b>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The Arts is an essential learning area and should be represented and described in terms of the allocation of learning time for each discipline as students move through a school.  The breadth and depth of curriculum delivery in the four arts disciplines should be described in terms of how this may change as students progress through the school.  For primary schools, there can be a close link between the arts learning experiences and the current emphasis on literacy and numeracy. The four unique disciplines offer a wide range of contexts for learning across the curriculum. In secondary schools, there will be programme details such as options and co-curricular arts activities that will influence overall depth and breadth of the essential learning areas.  From year 11 to 13 student choices of subject define depth and breadth.
	</p>

	<p>
		Approaches to assessment should be appropriate to the learning levels described in the curriculum document. Integral to this approach is the cycle of action and reflection.
Achievement standards for the arts are a useful tool for monitoring achievement and progress.  Advice and guidance on assessing and reporting in the arts should be consistent and related to the depth and breadth of curriculum.
