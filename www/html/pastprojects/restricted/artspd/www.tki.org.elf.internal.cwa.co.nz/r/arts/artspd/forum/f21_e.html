<h2 class="h2-forum">How does the curriculum expect me to deal with cultural issues in drama?</h2>

<p><a href="index_e.html">Back to Archived Forum Discussion index</a></p>

<p>Excerpts from forum discussion with Janinka Greenwood (Lecturer, Christchurch College of Education)<br>
12 June 2002</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b>
<br>
Kia ora and welcome to our drama forum with Janinka Greenwood. Janinka is an experienced and skilled teacher (with 30 years experience) who works with primary, secondary and tertiary students. Janinka is committed to teacher education and is currently lecturing at Christchurch College of Education where she works with students who are aiming to be teachers (primary and secondary). Janinka has the honour of gaining the first New Zealand PhD in Drama. She has written books on drama, one of which was launched in Christchurch recently. The focus for the forum this week is: How does the curriculum expect me to deal with cultural issues in drama? We will be looking at questions such as: How to do this in practice? Where to begin? Who to talk to? What resources are there? How do you do this without trampling all over someone else's culture? </p>

<p><b>Robert:</b>
<br>
I'm really pleased that we are discussing this topic today as I find it really difficult to manage cultural issues in my class. I have 12 kids in my class, all M&#257;ori, except one who is a little Swiss boy. I know from the aims of the curriculum that my programme should "reflect cultures and ethnic groups", but I have a feeling that I may not be doing justice to the little Swiss boy in my class, as most often we have our focus on things M&#257;ori. Our community support comes from a M&#257;ori perspective, and most of our context is M&#257;ori. How do you suggest that I include my little Swiss boy in this? My second challenge is that I am P&#257;keh&#257; teacher. </p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Win:</b>
<br>
Some of our secondary students have little understanding of the cultures of others and are sometimes not too tolerant of students from these cultures. Some of our students come from cultures in which they are 'shy' about expressing themselves. Can you suggest a 'safe' way for me to help these 'shy' students to contribute their ideas and to participate in drama?</p>

<p><b>Janinka Greenwood:</b>
<br>
 Kia ora everyone. It's a real pleasure to be here with you. Thanks for these queries/comments I got as I came in. To Robert and Win: I think that one of the real strengths of drama is that it allows us a way into subjects where we may feel shy, or not knowledgeable enough to speak out normally: we can set up a drama frame that allows us to investigate something together with our students. We don't have to be the experts &#8211;
 our drama can involve finding out. For instance, Robert, you talk about honouring both your M&#257;ori students and your Swiss students. How about setting up a drama in which the Swiss boy is writing or emailing relations, or a city, or a school about M&#257;ori culture in a way that goes beyond the tourism brochures. You could set a context in which the whole class alternatively takes the roles of the group in Switzerland and the roles of the M&#257;ori experts &#8211;
 and posts questions. Perhaps they might come together in the drama in some way, say on a marae? That makes it safe, because the characters within your drama do whatever you do. </p>

<p><b>Phil:</b>
<br>
Thanks. You have given me a good steer that I'll try with the class. Can you explain the sentence below that comes from <i>The Arts in the New Zealand Curriculum Statement</i> (p. 36) "Drama both expresses and is defined by the culture from which it emerges." It's the second part of that statement that I don't really understand. </p>

<p><b>Janinka:</b>
<br>
We all have "fixed ideas" about what drama is, and these are at least partly shaped by our culture. For example, some people think that Shakespeare is the model of 'real' drama, and have no time for experimental kinds of work. That is partly because their culture has led them to think of drama in that way. Another example is the way western culture sees role and dialogue as crucial elements of culture. In other cultures dialogue may not occur in drama at all &#8211;
 it may be carried out in narration and dance. And so on.</p>

<p><b>Hans:</b>
<br>
Most of my kids are M&#257;ori. I'd be interested in hearing about how you distinguish between using a cultural theme for drama (for example, a local legend) using non-M&#257;ori (European) conventions and using elements from different cultures, for example, parts of kapa haka as part of a general non-M&#257;ori theme. Is both OK? What permissions would I need for either/both? </p>

<p><b>Janinka:</b>
<br>
I think a lot depends on why we do the work and who we're going to show it to. I think it'
s important for all our students &#8211; even very young ones &#8211; to understand that every group feels precious and protective about some material. I use the model of telling our own story and having it acted back by the class. The person whose story it is watches very carefully &#8211;
 because they care &#8211;
 but they can enjoy other people showing their story. Once children understand that concept they can become partners in discussing what we can do and what we can't do. </p>

<p>
Re-enacting M&#257;ori stories within our classroom is a wonderful way of coming to understand what they are about. Modern dialogue can be great in bringing them to life. <br>
Use of haka can also bring life, and the drama frame can be a great reason to learn the haka. The thing about haka is that they belong to someone. So if we want to show the work publicly it's tactful, and also very useful, to bring in someone from the community, like a M&#257;ori parent or elder who that community recognises as expert in that field, so that our drama has a sincerity and truth. On the other hand it make work better for you and your students to write their own haka &#8211; in M&#257;ori or in English &#8211; again perhaps with the kind of help I described above. </p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Robert:</b>
<br>
Would you suggest that we transfer this model to other cultures too, so that if we have Asian students we would find a representative who is acknowledged by that community too? In other words does this apply to all cultural groups?</p>

<p><b>Janinka:</b>
<br>
Yes I think that's a good thing to do with respect to all cultures.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>It means our work will probably be more truthful.<br><br>
</li>

<li>It brings people from other cultures into our classrooms and can open up further interactions and make them more involved in young peoples'
 schooling.<br><br>
</li>

<li>It allows our students to see that the story/ art form has a real context: it's not just a technical thing &#8211; it's about someone's story.</li>
</ol>

<p>
On the other hand I don't think we should get totally neurotic about always bringing someone in. If it's in-school work, and enough knowledge is already there, then let's get on with the exploring.</p>

<p><b>Hans:</b>
<br>
I really appreciated your thoughtful reply, Janinka, particularly drawing a distinction between performing for the class where the process has to sit comfortably with the 'makers' of the drama, and the need for outside approval if for a public performance. A few years ago, I remember watching a theatre performance (<i>Waitohi</i> I think) by Witi Ihimaera that mixed the conventions very effectively. Are there any models of cross-cultural drama on film, video or print that are currently available? </p>

<p><b>Janinka:</b>
<br>
Witi Ihimaera's work such as <i>Woman Far Walking</i> is a great example. He mixes elements like haka with very colloquial conversations. It creates a very safe frame for all this, by creating a character &#8211;
 theoretically impossible, but dramatically convincing &#8211;
 who is as old as the Treaty. The use of this kind of frame makes the risks we take much more acceptable. For instance, how might a moon colony in the next century celebrate their New Zealand origins in a drama festival? How might a time traveller from Maui's time explain his society and Maui's exploits to kids in South Auckland? What kind of work might emerge once they got together on it? About resources: unfortunately there are still very few for primary/intermediate levels, though there is talk of developing some. Lobby the Ministry. Write to Peter O'Connor, Drama Coordinator.</p>

<p><b>Hans:</b>
<br>
Yes, the element of time (traditional past with contemporary life and language) is so useful in relating the topics to kids'
 lives. I'll be trying the moon-space idea. Hope Carol and Val are listening and can pass on to the powers that be that ongoing resourcing is needed. Drama has had very poor resource support for a long time! Thank goodness we now have a curriculum! </p>

<p>There are very few resources available online that relate drama- teaching to culture. The only one on TKI at the moment is a case study describing how Otahuhu College Drama Department carried out <i>The Tamatane Project,</i> playing out a M&#257;ori myth for a Chinese audience. Where can I look for more resources/ideas to work from, particularly for primary/intermediate level? </p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Carol Langton:</b>
<br>
As far as resources go, an excellent resource is the CD-ROM <i>Creative Explorer</i> &#8211; an interactive creative experience. Its drama focus is fronted by Michael Hurst (from <i>Hercules</i> and <i>Zena</i> fame) and the dance component focuses on Neil Ieremia. This CD-ROM is available from Learning Media and has been distributed to all schools. Also, soon to be on The Arts Online, will be a case study about Kapa Haka.This site is <a href="../materials/cs_e.html">http://www.tki.org.nz/r/arts/artspd/materials/cs_e.php</a></p>

<p><b>Val:</b>
<br>
You will find the case study: Multidisciplinary drama performance &#8211;
 Otahuhu College at the following URL:
<a href="../materials/cs_e.html">http://www.tki.org.nz/r/arts/artspd/materials/cs_e.php</a></p>

<p><b>Carol:</b>
<br>
I quote from Creative New Zealand <i>Celebrating The Art.</i> "...Katerina Te Heikoko Mataira (Ngati Porou), recipient of the 2001 To Tohu Tiketike a Te Waka Toi/Te Waka Toi Exemplary Award, is a leading figure in the renaissance of te reo M&#257;ori. Author, artist, academic, she credits her storytelling gift to her parents, Raniera and Erana Harrison. 'My father was a brilliant storyteller. He loved to tell ghost stories, then send one of us kids outside to fetch wood for the fire'." The oral tradition of storytelling is a fabulous place to focus drama for M&#257;ori
 students, do you agree, Janinka? </p>

<p><b>Janinka:</b>
<br>
Oral story telling is one of those culturally shaped concepts of drama that Phil alluded to. You can do wonderful things just by getting students to take different parts of a story, and different roles in the story, and just layer the way they tell their bit of the story. In addition, writings by people like Katarina Mataira, and Patricia Grace can also give us stories we can explore in movement improvisations, tableaux, snatches of dialogue, overhead photo projections etcetera, and perhaps even thread them together with parts of the oral story. And telling our own stories. I have an activity I call Boss of the Story. Someone tells their story; chooses others for the different roles; it is acted back with the story teller holding the right to stop the action if it's not the way they see their own story. The teacher acts as facilitator, helping the group value and honour and enjoy each story.</p>

<p><b>Val:</b>
<br>
As you have studied this topic so thoroughly it would be good if you could pass on any other important messages that we should have about cultural issues in drama during this last part of this session. </p>

<p>
<b>Janinka:</b>
<br>
I think we have to approach cross-cultural interaction with love and with passion. There's no usefulness in presenting cross-cultural work as something dehydrated or totally dangerous. For me the greatest drama possibilities are finding out and celebrating, and if we can set up drama frames that allow us to do that, we are really teaching. Making mistakes if fine and it's even more fine if we can set up some stage in the drama where we might go into role, perhaps with a 'cultural expert' joining us, say, as a group of critics who look back at the work that was made and evaluate how truthful it was in terms of the original story and its meaning, and of the meanings it acquired for those in the group. (It is their own work they're looking at but with the safety frame of a role).</p>

<p><b>Val:</b>
<br>
Thank you so much for being our guest on line today Janinka. I think I speak for everyone when I say that this has been a really great session. Your thoughtful and really useful responses have clarified many of the questions that we had about this topic. As teachers we will try to go "find out" and "celebrate" as you suggest. We hope that you will join us again on the forum at a later date. </p>

<p><b>Janinka:</b>
<br>
I've really enjoyed being with you and I wish you all well in your explorations. <br>
Remember when we talk culture we talk about our sense of identity, not just about shrines.  </p>
