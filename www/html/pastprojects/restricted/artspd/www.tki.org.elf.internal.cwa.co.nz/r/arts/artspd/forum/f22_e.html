<p><b>Val:</b> 
<br>
Do you think that dance &#8211; contemporary dance is relevant to young people in New Zealand? </p>
 <p>
<b>Mary Jane: </b><br>
Yes. Absolutely relevant. Contemporary dance is a very wide category as it can mean any dance practised or performed today. It can also be associated with 'new' dance, experimental dance, modern dance after 1960/70. I like the connotation/meaning of contemporary dance as dance as an art form.  </p>
<p><b>Val: </b><br>
What skills do you need to become a successful contemporary dancer? </p>
<p>
<b>Mary Jane:</b> 
<br>
Depends on what form or style of contemporary dance you mean (see above). Whatever the style, you need to be disciplined, focused, good at working with others, creatively sensitive but tough emotionally. </p>
<p><b>Val:</b> 
<br>
Would you encourage young people to pursue a career in dance? </p>
<p>
<b>Mary Jane:</b> 
<br>
Only if they are driven to dance and have to dance because they don't feel complete unless they dance!</p>
<p><b>Val:</b> 
<br>
It is often said that the working life of a dancer is short. Would you agree with that statement? </p>
<p>
<b>Mary Jane:</b> <br>
Yes. Though a dancer in their early thirties is at their peak and if they have good technique, they can dance for another 20 years because their body is well trained for safety and they know how to care for their physique. </p>
<p>
<b>Val:</b> 
<br>
From your biography, you have used dancing as a springboard to a wide range of other artistic work, for example, artistic director, freelance choreographer, governor for the Arts Foundation of NZ, amongst others. How challenging was it to make the transition from dancer to director? </p>
<p>
<b>Mary Jane:</b> 
<br>
At first I was a Director in Limbs as well as a dancer which was hard work but easier to lead, because I could bring everyone with me and they had to match or could feed off my dance energy. When I stopped dancing fulltime and directed Limbs and later The Auckland Dance Company, it was very hard because I know how tired and sore dancers get, but I could not empathise too much as there was always another show to do. </p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>
<p><b>Val:</b> 
<br>
 You have achieved some outstanding 'firsts' in your career, for example, choreographing for:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Opening Ceremony Of The Commonwealth Games in Auckland.<br><br>
</li>

<li><i>Jean &#8211; The Ballet Of Jean Batten</i> for the Royal New Zealand Ballet &#8211; the first performance at Auckland's new Aotea Centre.<br><br>
</li>

<li>the pageant <i>Te Rangimarie</i> for the Gisborne Dawn Ceremony on January 1st, 2000.</li>
</ul>
<p>How did your dance training prepare you for these important roles?</p> 

<p><b>Mary Jane:</b> 
<br>
As a young dancer I was privileged to always be involved in shows and performances so I gained some insight into what works theatrically, through osmosis more than anything else. I was trained in ballet, mainly, so that was focused on technique rather than the choreography. I then had the opportunity to choreograph heaps with Limbs (1977&#8211;86) so by the time I made those works you mentioned, I had developed skills of scale (the Commonwealth Games had a cast of 6000), storytelling <i>(Jean)</i> and for camera <i>(Te Rangimarie).</i> </p>
<p><b>Val:</b> 
<br>
What or who influenced you to become a dancer? </p>
<p><b>Mary Jane:</b> 
<br>
My mother and my early teachers. Also I kept getting good feedback from dancing &#8211;
 passing exams, winning stuff, feeling great when I danced &#8211;
 so just kept on doing it. Later in my teens I was very inspired by dancers I saw in New Zealand, read about or saw on movies or TV.</p>
<p><b>Val:</b> 
<br>
What do you think that we as teachers can best do to promote dance in schools? </p>
<p>
<b>Mary Jane:</b> 
<br>
The art of dance is a way for many students who are not academically inclined to find their own strengths. The new curriculum is a good document for teaching the students about the art of dance. Private dance teachers teach techniques such as ballet, jazz and contemporary. Maybe they can guest at the school? The school dance teacher can teach the art of dance through improvisation and composition games and take the students to see lots of dance or show them videos and films. Invite dance artists into the school but support them in working with the students. I have some videos and contacts if you want.</p>
<p>
Keep in touch with the dance organisations who are there to be advisers such as DANZ and ADEN.
<a href="mailto:Danz@danz.org.nz">Danz@danz.org.nz</a> </p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><b>Val:</b> 
<br>
 A teacher in a two-teacher rural school has in their class a little boy who just loves to dance. The teacher has no training in dance, they have no dance classes in their area and there is little interest in dance within the community. Should they encourage this child? What would be a good way forward for him? </p>
<p>
<b>Mary Jane:</b> 
<br>
The teacher must already have created some dance opportunities for their students so keep doing that. Get videos or movies with dance in them to show the range of dance styles and forms. Get to a dance workshop in your holidays to facilitate your skills in this area. Encourage him to keep active &#8211;
 maybe with a martial art? Doing drama, basketball etcetera. </p>
<p><b>Val:</b> 
<br>
What is the difference between classical ballet such as <i>Swan Lake</i> and contemporary ballet? </p>
<p>
<b>Mary Jane:</b> 
<br>
Classical ballet is just that &#8211;
 old style classic form such as the version of <i>Swan Lake</i> by Petipa, the Russian ballet choreographer who made his version in the late 19th century. Today people often do a version and say "
after Petipa"
 that is, after the classic version. Russell Kerr's version being toured now by the RNZBC is "
after Petipa". There are many contemporary versions of <i>Swan Lake</i> (like there are of Shakespeare's plays). I saw a contemporary version at the recent arts festival in Wellington by the Swedish choreographer Matz Ek. It was contemporary, because the steps were entirely different style from the classical ballet and the story was changed &#8211;
 but the music was the same as the classic version. Contemporary ballet as a technique &#8211;
 depending on who's teaching it &#8211;
 might include contemporary movement principles such as use of the torso, use of weight and off-balance. When I teach it I also ask the dancers to have a lower eyeline (more direct) arms higher in 5th (above the head in a proud confident way) etcetera. </p>
<p><b>Val:</b> 
<br>
What does it mean by "a modern version? Is the movement, vocabulary the same? Does the music remain the same? What changes? I think you have done a version of <i>Romeo and Juliet.</i> </p>
<p>
<b>Mary Jane:</b> 
<br>
Yes <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> and also <i>Giselle.</i> <i>Giselle</i> was my most successful modern version of a classic ballet. I just used the Act 2 part of the music but also added chimes and heartbeats. I set it on another planet and asked the dancers to all imagine they were ballerinas who had danced the role of Giselle on earth and were remembering their roles. The steps were often alluding to or modern versions of the classic version. (I had danced the classic version and knew it really well so could confidently 'contemporise' the steps). See a review of this version on my website. 
<a href="http://www.aucklanddance.co.nz/" target="_blank">www.aucklanddance.co.nz</a> in repertoire. </p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><b>Val:</b> 
<br>
How does music relate to movement in your work? </p>
<p>
<b>Mary Jane:</b> 
<br>
In my early work in Limbs (see <a href="http://www.aucklanddance.co.nz/" target="_blank">www.aucklanddance.co.nz</a> under Limbs Dance Company) nearly all the works I made were driven by the music. If I felt an emotional connection to the music and could see images it inspired me to do, I would often make a work to that music. Rock, Jazz, avant garde, classical, whatever. Over the years I have often had the opportunity to make a work and have music especially written for it. This is a great process and if the relationship is smooth &#8211;
 which I'm glad to say for me it usually is &#8211;
 the composer will either write the music to my descriptions and then I'll choreograph it. Or (especially with video dance) it's great to have the music made after I've edited the dancework. Music can have many relationships with dance &#8211;
 in time/on the beat or any distance from the dance &#8211;
 just to create atmosphere or meeting at points but otherwise only vaguely related. The music can also be a juxtaposition or it can add other imagery. </p>
<p><b>Carol Langton:</b> 
<br>
My question is from a teacher in a rural school in the South Island. Once you have taken your class to see the Royal NZ Ballet, a Limbs performance, or any professional dance performance, are there any strategies we should know about to recapture that magic once we get back into our wee, everyday classroom settings and try to teach dance? </p>
<p>
<b>Mary Jane:</b> 
<br>
I think its great to ask the students what they noticed. Maybe before they go you could discuss this so they watch with a certain approach. Not about whether they 'liked' the work but what did they see/notice. This can be on the level of the craft (choreographic elements) or on the level of metaphor/symbolism &#8211;
 what did it look like/remind you of? Afterwards they could draw, write a poem, take a quality/step and enlarge on it in their own dance way &#8211;
 improvising or composing a new dance from what they saw. </p>
<p><b>Val:</b> 
<br>
Mary Jane, thank you so much for your generosity in taking the time to consider our questions so thoroughly and for providing us with such a wealth of useful information in your responses. Your answers have provided a rich source of dance information for us. You've not only given us a lot to reflect on and great resources to pursue, but you have also given us a wonderful glimpse into your world of dance. On behalf of everyone on The Arts Online, a huge thank you. We hope you will join us on the forum again in the future. </p>
