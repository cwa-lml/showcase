<p><a href="index_e.html">Back to Archived Forum Discussion index</a></p>

<p>Excerpts from forum discussion with Wayne Flanagan (Drama teacher and The Arts Online advisory team member)<br>
4 November 2002
</p>

<p>
<b>Val Duthie:</b><br> 
Kia ora, welcome to the final drama forum for this year with Wayne Flanagan (drama teacher and the Arts Online advisory team member). Wayne will be discussing drama planning for 2003.</p>  

<p>Wayne writes, <i>'The best teaching occurs within a context. Instead of trying to teach what an 'element' is, let it evolve from an action you are actively involved with. You may be improvising in class whether a mining company should be allowed to operate in your town (e.g., Waihi). Students will become different characters &#8211; mayor, housewife, teacher, and miner. Now you can talk about their 'role,' 'action,' 'focus', etc. Note that any space may be used for such a drama so you need not be limited by classroom confines. Read the orange books, The Arts in the New Zealand curriculum and Drama in the classroom. Watch the video. Dare to trust yourself. It always works out. Break a leg!'</i></p>

<p><b>Wayne Flanagan:</b><br>
Planning for drama will make sure that you and your students have a fun 2003. Have a look at your orange books to find out what you should be teaching. If you don't understand ask me any question you like. Think of a context to teach within. It might be a local issue to try process drama or it might be a movie like <i>'Harry Potter'</i> or a book or whatever. Let's throw some ideas around and see where we end up.</p>

<p><i>Can you suggest how I can plan a unit with a personal stories class theme?</i></p>

<p><b>Tim:</b><br>
I'm to be teaching a year 5 group next year and they will be older than the children I am working with this year. I thought we would use Paroa School's work as a basis for our planning (p.14, <i>Drama in the Classroom</i>). How do you suggest I plan for this? Can you suggest other ways that I can work with a personal stories theme with this class?
</p>

<p><b>Wayne Flanagan:</b><br>
Yes this would be a great way to plan a unit. 
</p>

<ol>
<li>Ask the students to bring in a photo from home </li>
<li>In small groups, they can retell the circumstances of their photos</li> 
<li>Then create a storyboard of their stories focussing on the beginning, middle and end (simple pictures are great with captions)</li> 
<li>Create a freeze frame of these 3 stages (demonstrate the focus of the freeze frame)</li> 
<li>Decide on roles/characters &#8211; Use 'role on the wall' convention to create depth of characters and 'hot seating', if you please</li> 
<li>Rehearse beginning and ending with 'freeze frames'</li> 
<li>Introduce 'speaking thoughts aloud' </li>
<li>Perform to peers. </li>
</ol>

<p>This is a great starter unit that can be integrated easily across the curriculum. Terrific for the class to get to know each other and the teacher (bring in your own photos).</p>

<p><b>Tim:</b><br>
What other ways can I develop the 'personal stories' theme with this class?</p>

<p><b>Wayne Flanagan:</b>
Personal stories can be extended to include others' stories. Once the kids have re-enacted their own stories have them meld one story with another.
</p>

<ol>
<li>Take a character from one story and place them in a scene with a character from a different story. Make sure they have physical characteristics. Let them use simple script from their original scenes. You'll end up with some fascinating results. Trust the process.</li> 
<li>Let other characters enter the fray one at a time </li>
<li>Discuss the use of elements and techniques</li> 
<li>Use conventions to guide their discovery</li> 
<li>Have groups develop other 'simple' cultures, with language and customs</li> 
<li>Introduce cultures to each other and see if they can work out each other's custom</li> 
<li>Reflect upon what happened.</li>
</ol>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>How can we integrate this starter plan into our drama plan for next year?</i></p>

<p><b>Sheryl:</b><br>
Good to have this opportunity to speak about planning for next year. I read your reply to Tim and wondered how we could best integrate this starter unit with our drama plan for the year. Where would you suggest we go next?
</p>

<p><b>Wayne Flanagan:</b><br>
After the starter outlined above you could choose a multitude of directions. Firstly, check out the <i>Arts Curriculum</i> book p40&#8211;43 for their learning examples and link to <i>'Drama in the classroom'</i> book pp6&#8211;11. These will form a basis for 'what' to teach. Either use the planning unit at the rear of the book or use the website in Jean's reply. If you want to create your own flow-on from my previous example you may try to extend the stories idea to include other people and other cultures. Integrate your unit so that the students' research others lives using the web, library, taping parents and friends. Let them discover problems that can be 'played out' during process drama. Using this method means you will be able to cover the four strands with relative ease and all children's learning styles will be accessed making it enjoyable. Trust your instincts. The unit could travel anywhere once it begins.
</p>

<p><i>How useful do you find the planning templates online and how do you plan?</i></p>

<p><b>Jean:</b><br>
I have been looking up the planning template on Arts Online. <a href="http://www.tki.org.nz/r/arts/artspd/word/Drama_planner.doc" target="_blank">http://www.tki.org.nz/r/arts/artspd/word/Drama_planner.doc</a>. It has spaces for achievement objectives, learning outcomes, summative and formative assessment, links with other essential learning areas, skill development and resource materials.  
</p>

<ol>
<li>Have you used this template? If so, how helpful did you find it?</li>  
<li>Can you tell us how you plan ahead for drama in your school?</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Wayne Flanagan:</b><br>
Yes, I do use the drama unit planner template. It allows you to consider all areas of your plan and to reflect upon what you've achieved. I plan school wide for our drama classes. Students come to me in half-class sizes for six one and a half-hour lessons. This allows me to develop a continual process covering the curriculum. However some teachers ask me to plan within their unit plan contexts and this works well too. I choose to teach elements, techniques and conventions within a context so that it's easy to understand, and part of a process. If you need more specifics let me know.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>How many conventions should we be planning to introduce with a year 3 group?</i></p>

<p><b>Sheryl:</b><br>
How many conventions should we be planning to introduce with a year 3 group?</p>

<p><b>Wayne Flanagan:</b><br>
<i>Drama in the classroom</i> states, <i>'Conventions are ways of working or strategies that we use to structure and sequence (or frame) dramatic action'</i> (p.8). It is not important how many conventions that are used at year 3 or any level. It is important that conventions are used to <i>'deepen understanding, or add impact in drama work'</i>. On page 40 of the Arts curriculum, one learning example suggests the use of <i>'Freeze&#8211;Frame images to represent specific moments from the stories'</i>. This is a great start as it will also create a focus for the students and it is an easy instructional method that will assure you have control and the students will be clear on what you expect them to do. In fact all of the conventions work in this manner. Try them, as you will be able to establish your own balance, being aware to use them for specific purposes (e.g., the use of 'role on the wall' to deepen the understanding of a character). Pages 8&#8211;10 of <i>'Drama in the Classroom'</i> list a whole bunch of them. Watch the video for clues as well.

<p><i>How are activities linked to a line of enquiry?</i></p>

<p><b>Phil:</b><br>
In an earlier forum you were discussing aesthetic education and you illustrated your comments with the following: <i>Take for example a drama unit on Harry Potter. <br>
Open journal: What is a wizard? What frightens us? <br>
Line of inquiry: How might Harry Potter help us to discover who we are? <br>
Activities: Making wands (kinaesthetic); poems (linguistic); strategy games (logistics); maps (spatial); and songs (musical). <br>
Thus, the subject area you focus on is up to you.</i></p>

<p>Wayne, can you explain how the activities above are linked to the line of inquiry? I can understand the open journal work, and the line of inquiry section. I can see the activities as useful extension work, but I'm not sure how it links together.</p>

<p><b>Wayne Flanagan:</b><br>
Thank you for mentioning aesthetic education as a method of planning. This would be a great way to prepare for 2003. Briefly, Aesthetic Education is a way to engage students with art forms. The teacher plans a unit around a work of art (Harry Potter for example, or a dance piece, visual art, play, music work...). A line of inquiry is established (how can <i>Harry Potter</i> help us to find the magic in our lives?). From the line of inquiry activities are created that the students engage in. At the close of the unit students view (or listen to) the art piece. The intent is that students will now be actively engaged with the artwork because they have attempted aspects of it themselves and thus they may be more open to an 'aesthetic experience'. So, Phil, the activities are supposed to be related to the artwork and the line of inquiry. In the example I used previously wands represent magic and are a great kinaesthetic beginning (remember I was also explaining the importance of using as many of the multiple intelligences as possible as a way of engaging students as well. Poetry, strategic games, maps and songs relate in the same way. In <i>Harry Potter</i> these activities are all used in the film). The line of inquiry is a guide in the creation of learning activities, the students never know that the question exists. Let me know if this clears it up for you. 
</p>

<p><b>Phil:</b><br>
I'm still a bit confused. "Wands represent magic and are a great kinaesthetic beginning"? I still find this a difficult concept. If, for example, the student makes a wand (that has a notion of magic attached to it, but is in fact a 3D object that has no particular 'power' in itself), I still can't see how that increases their understanding so that they can better understand the line of inquiry. Is it that by holding a wand, children can imagine the power of the magic? I can see how the other activities can help children understand better some aspects of the inquiry.</p>

<p><b>Wayne Flanagan:</b><br>
I think you are thinking a little too deeply, Phil. The wand doesn't have to help the student understand the line of inquiry. It is just a 'nice' way of introducing this unit and relates to the <i>Harry Potter</i> story because there are wands in the story. Certainly they will 'endow' the wand with magical qualities as children do with all of their play. One use for the wand that I use is to make it out of a pencil or pen. When you write with it, it can only write the truth. Get the children to use it when writing in their private journals. They will be 'hooked' into the unit because they are enjoying themselves.

<p><i>How do you plan for using drama resources for your school?</i></p>

<p><b>Wendy:</b><br>
No one has mentioned drama resource planning so far. You are working in a much bigger school than I am Wayne, but I would be interested to hear how you plan for using drama resources at your school.</p>

<p><b>Wayne Flanagan:</b><br>
As usual for teachers, resources may come from a multitude of areas. Keep your eyes open for anything of interest in your own area such as videos, posters, performances, and local performing artists. Students may bring in objects from home that they are attuned to for a special reason. I planned a unit once around a child's toy snake. However there are official avenues available for you to use as well. Val has kindly e-mailed me the following list that should give you a wealth of resources to choose from. Drama in the Classroom: A resource for teachers of Year 1&#8211;10: Published by Learning Media, Wellington 2000 for the Ministry of Education. This consists of two video programmes and a booklet that help teachers understand the elements, techniques, and conventions used in drama. There are many links between the material on the TKI website and the content of the Drama in the Classroom video. Both resources are directly based on the curriculum and use the same drama language &#8211; the elements, techniques, and conventions. The table below shows some of the links between the video and the Te Kete Ipurangi (TKI) website.

I thought I should contribute a few resource ideas to the vast pool of ideas already collected.  First of all, on <i>The Arts Online</i> we have a case study called Half Moon Bay. It deals with dramatising a controversial community issue in a small school on Stewart Island &#8211; check it out at: <a href="http://www.tki.org.nz/r/arts/artspd/materials/cs_e.php">http://www.tki.org.nz/r/arts/artspd/materials/cs_e.php</a>. Also in the 'Teacher Issues' section of <i>The Arts Online</i>, there is an answer to a question about what to consider when teaching drama to students with special needs. Peter O'Connor, the National Coordinator for Drama, wrote this and it has some interesting ideas regarding teaching students with differences and could possibly be referred to when looking for guidance about teaching students from various cultures.</p>

<p><b>Wayne Flanagan:</b><br>
Thanks for referring us to <i>The Arts Online</i> case studies Carol. All of the case studies are terrific reading so if you are lost for ideas they will help get you motivated. I have further searched for Gloria only to be informed that we may have to contact individual embassies for appropriate protocols of differing cultures. This seems like a situation where the students themselves may be the most valuable resource!

Another possible source of useful information is the subject association NZADIE. As well as their web site <a href="http://www.nzadie.org.nz/" target="_blank">http://www.nzadie.org.nz/</a> they produce a journal and Vol 25 December 2001 is an edition, which is entitled <i>A Special Edition for Primary Drama</i>. You might want to look out for this and other journals, which have very useful information to support the teaching of drama in education.
</p>

<p><b>Wayne Flanagan:</b><br>
Thanks for mentioning NZADIE, it's a great organisation that schools or individuals may join to get together and workshop drama ideas. As far as multi-level teaching is concerned drama is a great medium to integrate the whole class/school. Plan an activity as usual with clear learning objectives. Look at the curriculum document achievement objectives to ascertain the development progression through the levels. This will provide a basis for assessment. Give each level of student clear instructions as to their role in the activity e.g., that you may choose as a context a visit to the local vet, exploring the use of elements and techniques. This would allow all students to be actively engaged at their own level.
