<p>Excerpts from forum discussion with Ann Brodie (National Coordinator &#8211; The Visual Arts)<br>
23 October 2002</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b><br>
Kia ora, welcome to another visual arts forum with Ann Brodie (National Coordinator &#8211; The Visual Arts) as our guest online. Our discussion topic this week is Sculpture. During the forum we will be discussing: 
<ul>
<li>what is unique about sculpture</li>
<li>where to find ideas for sculpture</li> 
<li>what materials and tools you can use for making sculpture</li> 
<li>the terms we use to talk about it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ref: <i>Sculpture: Exploring the Visual Arts in Years 1&#8211;6</i> (Ministry of Education curriculum resource)</p>
<br>

<p><i>Where can we find out more about time-based media?</i></p>

<p><b>Pamela:</b><br>
I've had a good look at <i>Sculpture: Exploring the Visual Arts in Year 1&#8211;6</i> booklet as we are working on a clay sculpture unit at the moment. We are learning terms such as 3D, positive and negative space, and balance. I've found the booklet really useful. I had a look at the glossary at the back of the book and read so many terms that I don't know. Terms like: armature, bas-relief, bisque, maquette, and slake. This has prompted us to set up a small research exercise with the class.  We have asked them to find out about these 'new' terms and to report back to the class at the end of the unit. Under three-dimensional media it gives examples such as fibres, clay, wood, metal, glass, bone, plastics and, for time-based media, film and videotape. Where can we find out more about time-based media? </p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>Can we write and/or contact one of the artists in the book through the forum?</i></p>

<p><b>Tessa:</b><br>
We have been using clay recently and sculpting clay figures. I have used the Sculpture book for guidance and inspiration. It is great. We are too far away from 'civilisation' to take the class to visit a potter, but can we talk to one of these artists featured in the book? Could we write to them, or speak to them on a Forum sometime?  That would be great.</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b><br>
We would be happy to invite any of the artists published in the Ministry of Education's resource booklets onto the forum as our guests online. If you could identify the artist(s) that would be of particular interest to you, please email the details to <a href="mailto:val@cwa.co.nz" target="_blank">val@cwa.co.nz</a> and I will approach them and ask if they are willing to participate.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>Can you suggest how we can get children to develop their own ideas using the knowledge available?</i></p>

<p><b>Gloria:</b><br>
I teach at a small rural school in the north. We have many carvers in our community who can inspire our young children about sculpture. Many of their ideas come from the plants they see in the bush, or from the carvings in the meeting houses. I would like to encourage our children to develop their own ideas, and to use things that are important to them. To find ideas from things that they are familiar with and that they know something about. Can you suggest how we should set about finding appropriate ideas for sculpture that use the knowledge that the carvers can offer, but that give the children a chance to develop their own ideas too?</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b><br>
How fortunate you are to have carvers available and able to inspire and instruct the children! That is ideal. They will, of course, as well as existing whare whakairo be able to provide the stories and meanings for the children to learn. The logical step is to have the children consider shapes and objects that are significant to them and design their own sculptural works in response. </p> 

<p>Have you looked at the new Pou unit on <i>The Arts Unwrapped</i>? Also I am just preparing a beautiful exemplar unit at level 3 on low relief figures set in a gabled space, using Cliff Whiting and Bob Jahnke as models. Those will be available in the middle of 2003. The children begin with looking at traditional forms and then at how they are used in contemporary works.</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b><br>
Reference for the Pou unit that Ann referred to: <a href="http://www.tki.org.nz/e/arts/visarts/visarts_L3/visarts_L3_A4_menu.php">http://www.tki.org.nz/e/arts/visarts/visarts_L3/visarts_L3_A4_menu.php</a></p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>What is unique about sculpture? Are potters sculptors?</i></p>

<p><b>Louise:</b><br>
I saw Tessa's question and wonder if a potter is also a sculptor? I had thought of them separately, but I guess that both potter and sculptor can make clay works. I guess that begs the question, what it unique about sculpture?</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b><br>
The answer is yes and no. I guess I would like to make the distinction between model making and sculpture. Sculpture has its own language and set of concepts.  Sculptural concepts are so exciting and often evocative, e.g., balance, stretch, extend, suspend... there are so many. It can be entirely abstract. Model making is less abstract obviously and involves the creation of a one-off object &#8211; seems to imply representational, i.e. like a real object. I need to ponder in order to give a definitive answer on this one, although I think there will always be crossovers, grey areas.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>Help with finding objects for sculpture with limited budget, and using driftwood and Len Lye models.</i></p>

<p><b>Amy:</b><br>
I don't know about other teachers in country schools, but I have a limited art budget and have difficulty getting materials for activities like sculpture. We can buy clay but I would rather use things like steel and cement, and wire and found objects.  Seems I have a lot of trouble 'finding objects'. Any clues here?</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b><br>
I became a great scavenger for anything that looks useful. You are talking about the heavies of sculpture. You can get great results with low tech and found materials too. Sure concrete is good. You can make a clay low relief work, cover it with plaster of paris and cast concrete in the space left when you remove the clay. I like to do paper mache over clay too &#8211; you then remove the clay while it is wet (damp) and reuse it. Do you know the work of Malcolm Harrison? Uses drift wood... finds lengths and hot glues them as figures then clothes them &#8211; a great stitchery and fabric unit for children. Try using natural materials to create sculptural works that can be time-based as well, as they decay or melt, etc. The artist is Andy Goldsworthy.</p>

<b>Val Duthie:</b><br>
Reference for Andy Goldsworthy: URL <a href="http://cgee.hamline.edu/see/goldsworthy/see_an_andy.html" target="_blank">http://cgee.hamline.edu/see/goldsworthy/see_an_andy.html</a>

<p><b>Hans:</b><br>
Being in a country area too, I've been gathering some 'found objects' &#8211; farm machinery bits and bobs. I think they can also be made into sculpture &#8211; any good examples of actual 'found' sculpture objects online or in books that I can use as examples with my year 9&#8211;10 kids?</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b><br>
For found sculpture, look up object trouve and assemblage sculptor Louise Nevilson &#8211; she is great for the latter. Whatever you elect to do, keep the elements and principles of art in mind. Think of them, talk to the students about them, evaluate the message of the sculpture as well as discuss the feel of them. Find those wonderful concept words like leaning and stretching &#8211; sounds like dance!</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b><br>
Look at <i>Action Arts</i> newsletter for web sites that will assist you. There are some sculpture texts too &#8211; try the National Library.</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b><br>
Amy, there is a lovely unit in which you can use shells, stones and other collected treasures and stitch them in place with, say, bold cross stitches. Blanket stitch a piece of wrapped fabric around the body of limbs, make a traveller, a warrior, etc. Harrison gives them wings and shields using appropriately shaped wood. It is often softened by exposure and can be pierced so needles can pass through.</p>

Reference for Malcolm Harrison: <a href="http://www.textiles.org.nz/profiles/malcolmh/" target="_blank">http://www.textiles.org.nz/profiles/malcolmh/</a></p>

<p><b>Amy:</b><br>
Would it be possible to do a Len Lye type of thing with driftwood?</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b><br>
Len Lye, yes, you could use driftwood. How to animate it is the question. One suggestion is that wind could move a balanced or suspended part of it, if it were sitting on a fulcrum perhaps.</p> 

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b><br>
Reference for Len Lye. The Govett-Brewster Art Gallery is home to the collection and archive of modernist filmmaker and kinetic sculptor Len Lye: <a href="http://www.govettb.org.nz/lenlye/" target="_blank">www.govettb.org.nz/lenlye/</a> &#8211; 13k </p>

<p><i>Have you any strategies for encouraging children to work from all sides not just the front?</i></p>

<p><b>Louise:</b><br>
I really enjoy working in three-dimensional form (3D), but the children often forget that working in 3D means that they have to consider their work from 'all sides'. They are keen to get the front part working, but spend little time with the rest. Can you give me any strategies to help me overcome this?</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b><br>
Louise, I guess it is up to you to keep reminding the students to walk around or turn their sculptures as appropriate. It is worth beginning with low-relief concepts and then progressing to 'in the round', i.e. fully 3D. That is how humans began to sculpt. At first they couldn't get away from the original flat or square shape. It took a long time for self-supporting human sculptures to be made. Look at the Greeks through from Archaic to Hellenistic periods. By the time they got to the latter, they could suggest 'will' or a soul. </p>

<p><i>What should we be looking for when assessing a sculpture?</i></p>

<p><b>Glenda:</b><br>
What should we be looking for when assessing a sculpture?</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b><br>
Assessment. SLOs that relate to the AOs and the particular task is the answer.  Hard to get into this without a context I guess. PK would need the use of elements, principles and materials, and DI would measure the success in terms of the intended outcome. Then talking about CI would be lovely to explore. A great language exercise.</p>

<b>Val Duthie:</b><br>
Re. assessment: I would recommend that you look at the following site on assessment on TKI:<br>
The National Exemplars Trial site <a href="http://www.tki.org.nz/e/assessment/">http://www.tki.org.nz/e/assessment/</a>, e.g. <a href="http://www.tki.org.nz/r/assessment/exemplars/arts/visarts/index_e.php">http://www.tki.org.nz/r/assessment/exemplars/arts/visarts/index_e.php</a><br>
In this Level 1 Sculpture exemplar about clay animals, there is information under the following headings: 
<ul>
<li>What the work shows </li>
<li>Significant ideas</li> 
<li>Evidence of achievement</li> 
<li>Indicators.</li>
</ul>

In addition, the site provides information on: 
<ul>
<li>Curriculum links and specific learning outcomes</li> 
<li>Background that documents the sequence and teacher/student conversations</li> 
<li>Where to next.</li>
</ul>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>Is acting out characterisation important for figurative work?</i></p>

<p><b>Pamela:</b><br>
When making a figurative sculpture work, do you think that it is important for children to act out the character/action/expression or pose themselves before starting on the sculpture? I have found it helpful, as my class then really have to think about where the various parts of their bodies are placed and that helps them understand the concept of balance a bit more, I think. I wonder, though, if that is helpful to them if they really want to be expressive?</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b><br>
Yes, it is almost essential to prepare by exploring how bodies work when in particular poses. Another lovely idea is to colour sculptures to fit mood, e.g. cold colours/sad/warm/happy etc. You could create a plaster-wrapped wire armature sculpture, and when it is dry you could use a pointillist (dotted paint) technique to complete it in the appropriate combinations of emotionally expressive colours.</p>
