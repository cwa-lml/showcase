<p>Excerpts from forum discussion with Merryn Dunmill (National Coordinator &#8211; Music),<br>
20 February 2002</p>


<p>This forum is the first in a series of music forums based around the Music Handbook <i>Into Music 1 Classroom Music in Year 1&#8211;3</i> (a Learning Media resource distributed to all schools at the end of 2001). Our special guest on these forums will be Merryn Dunmill, National Coordinator for the Arts &#8211; Music. Merryn will be online to discuss Activity One with you during the forum. There is a range of ways in which you can prepare for the forum and get 'added value' from the discussion. You are invited to:</p>

</ul>

<p><b>Kura:</b> 
<br>
Some background information on our area and school here in South Hokianga. The school is an Area School with approximately 340 pupils. We have a total immersion M&#257;ori unit from New Entrants to Yr 8's as well as mainstream primary and secondary students. Our hope is to inspire and excite our students in their learning and especially through learning who they are. The majority of students are M&#257;ori and they have limited knowledge of whakapapa, tikanga and the significance of the history of this moana and whenua. We hope to give them some knowledge of cultural music, through waiata tawhito and the arts, and through experiential learning. Can you help or do you know of resources and references we may access &#8211; especially listening to traditional M&#257;ori music and instruments?</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b> 
<br>
I'll start by responding to Kura first re M&#257;ori music: There are some excellent resources already available and more to be produced especially as Nga Toi resources are developed for Kura Kaupapa. Then there is the nga toi of the Arts document and this is an area that needs to be developed greatly. <b>But</b> the following may be just what you are looking for to support your programme: <i>Learning In and Through the Art Toi Puroro Taonga Puoro</i> produced by Tawera Productions Wellington and the Ministry of Education (1999). This shows off the wonderful instruments, their taonga, construction, performance and so on. It's a great resource of a CD, book and video.</p> 

<p>Hirini Melbourne has some songbooks: <i>Te Wao Nui a Tane</i> (Huia Publisher's book and CD). Great publisher by the way and lots more here including <i>Toiapiapi</i> also by Hirini. 
<br>
Then there's <i>Hei Waiata, Hei Whakakoakoa</i> from Learning Media in Wellington (book and tape).</p> 

<p><i>Kiwikidsongs</i> have a range of good songs in te reo, too, and some which relate to tikanga. Also, check out <a href="http://www.maorimusic.com/" target="_blank">http://www.maorimusic.com</a>, which is amazing. Later this term the NZ Music Industry is putting out free to schools a package of CDROM, CD and teacher resource book of 16 New Zealand contemporary rock music tracks which include Mahinarangi Tocker, Hinewehi Mohi, Che Fu and Pacific Island group Te Vaka plus heaps more: lots of cool stuff for the older Year 9&#8211;10 students to get into.</p> 

      <p>There is also <a href="http://www.maori.org.nz/" target="_blank">http://www.maori.org.nz/</a>for 
        more general resources. The Kapa haka National Festival will be on television 
        and there should be video/media footage available to purchase from TVNZ 
        soon, too.</p> 

<p>It would be great to get in any local community musicians who are good role models to talk to the students and motivate them about music: how music is the basis to culture and understanding and to using our own personal compass for living life in an emotionally satisfying way. Music can turn kids' lives around for the better and enhance all learning across the curriculum, so any practical activities and knowledge development through listening is essential.</p> 

<p>I thought it might be useful to add a few lovely CD's available for motivating students about M&#257;ori music.</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Oceania</i> which is a commercial world music take; and</li>
<li><i>Te Ku Te Whe</i> &#8211; traditional instruments performed by Richard Nunns and Hirini Melbourne</li>
</ul>

<p>Mahinarangi Tocker has at least one CD released as do: Big Belly Woman, Whirimako Black, Ruia and Rania (including a CD in te reo of most of Bob Marley's biggest hits); Prince Tui Teka, Dalvanius, Te Waka Huia, South Side of Bombay, Herbs, Hinewehi Mohi, Moana and the Moahunters. (<i>Tahi</i> and <i>Rua</i> are fantastic and <i>Tahi</i> includes a section in English on traditional instruments and talks about how they are used and were used &#8211; now incorporated brilliantly into their contemporary music). And the most famous of late, Anika Moa who is such an amazing role model for our young wahine. There are so many more including our Kiri Te Kanawa of course.</p>

<p><b>Ann N:</b> 
<br>
In my school the kids seem to me to be dominated by pop music. My query is what strategies would you suggest I use for listening to this music and deepening their experience? Also, how do I move them on from this and broaden their music listening?</p> 

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b> 
<br>
Their interests are always the best place to start, then make connections with what they listen to: "How does this piece sound like that one?"</p> 

<p>Repeat listenings are important, too, because sometimes the first listen is lost on the ears. It takes time to learn to like some music but discussing its features keeps it as a focus and away from personal taste.</p> 

<p><b>Ann N:</b> 
<br>
I like the idea of repeated listening to develop deeper meaning and would love some strategies to do this in a way that isn't seen as too repetitive &#8211; I want to keep the children's enthusiasm levels up!</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b>
<br>
With repeated listenings you can have an activity change for each listening. For example, say you took <i>In The Hall of the Mountain King</i> for Year 5/6, it is longish. First time, tell the story about the trolls and get them to imagine the action &#8211; talk about it. Next time, move in response to sound: check out the arts online professional development video on this. Next time, get instruments and play along with the rhythms. Try writing out the rhythms even in Morse code ie ......_.._.._............_ (That's the opening rhythm that repeats lots). Compose your own Morse code versions and play along...and so on.</p> 

<p>Perform your own version using words instead of music but doing the elements identified, for example, soft to loud, slow to fast, low to high.</p> 

<p>Choreograph the rhythms. Moving freely to the music is another valid activity for listening too, or just stomping the beat! </p>

<p>Sometimes as a wind down after repeated listenings, a later replay can be used for drawing to the music as pure emotional release. Play the said piece each day for a week at a set time for packing up or setting up another activity. Choose a new piece each week for music-focused listening, then as background. Eventually, they can choose from a repertoire of music you have provided and nominate favourites. You'll be amazed how things grow on them and they will never forget this music: throughout their lives it will have meaning to them on some level. Think about songs that are special to you: bet you listened lots!</p>

<p><b>Ann N:</b> 
<br>
Thank you Merryn &#8211; I now feel like I have a starting point and something I can develop in my class. It's great to be able to have this kind of discussion; it helps to clarify my thinking also. </p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Sue Cheesman:</b>
<br>
Following on from Ann's question, do you have any suggestions about tracks of songs instrumentals that would act like a step-by-step approach to broaden the listening in a not-too-radical way?</p> 

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b> 
<br>
I come from a visual arts background and we talk a lot about "seeing" rather than "listening" as a fundamental way of sharing our responses to our world. There are so many different ways of seeing. I guess that there are many ways of listening too.</p> 

<p>When you are providing listening experiences to broaden students' musical vocabulary and horizons, what are some strategies to focus the listening experience?</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b> 
<br>
There is no step-by-step music as such. All music can be listened to &#8211; it's how it is heard. The teacher needs to take the student through activities as in the chapter in <i>Into Music</i> where the first step is to ensure the right environment, then to focus on what is available in the music to discuss in relation to the elements and features of music heard.</p> 

<p>One piece might be chosen, for example, a salsa for rhythmic focus and playback. "Listen to this rhythm. Let's play it back by ear." Another work might be good for a range of elements such as <i>In the Hall of the Mountain King</i> by Grieg, which starts slow and soft, gets louder and faster and higher by using higher register of instruments, and so on. This is detailed on page 12 of the handbook. <i>Tihore Mai</i> by Hirini Melbourne features traditional M&#257;ori instruments, female voices in harmony and chant. You can hear poi as the percussion etcetera. The handbook takes you through activities step-by-step and relates it all to learning outcomes for students.</p> 

<p>Young students find it difficult to sustain concentration during long works, so shorter exciting pieces or extracts are best. Movement to music is important, too. We all listen differently, as Val notes in the viewing world example. Some kids like to move, others like to close eyes and others like to fiddle with something tactile. Whatever, as long as everyone can hear good quality sound, there should be room for great aesthetic experiences to be happening for all.</p> 

<p>Teachers, try taking your own favourite piece of music and talking about it with the class. Your passion will be infectious. Why do you like it? What can you hear in it? What feelings does it evoke? How about choosing one you don't like and doing the same? How would you improve it? Get the class to do the same thing and share their ideas with others.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b> 
<br>
We do not have anyone who can play the piano at our school and we rely on tapes and CD's. I find that the children do not sing in tune when singing along with tapes etcetera. I don't know why this is so. Can you give any suggestions? Some of the songs are not always suited to the children's voice ranges either.</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b>
<br>
If the children are not singing in tune, it is either because the music is too loud and they aren't listening to each other, or it is too far out of their voice range. Some tapes are bad for this. <i>Kiwikidsongs</i> are designed to suit student voices and have students singing so it is good modelling for them. Adult voices are usually too low for little ones. Try turning the stereo down and selecting a small group of good voices to lead the class in singing.</p> 

<p>Students from other classes can help here, too. Once the class hears in-tune singing they can match their own sound to this. Also, by turning down the stereo they may quieten their own singing &#8211; often another problem; when they shout they always sing out of tune.</p> 

<p>It's all about listening. Putting one hand over one ear and singing and listening to oneself is a good technique. Get the students to phase in and out like turning the volume knob up and down. They can then check when they come back in to the song if they are in tune, still. Sometimes, stop the singing and mouth the words at the signal of a leader. For example, hands closed for quiet inside-the-head singing, then open for join-in-the right-place, in tune and in time. It's a bit of a game but great for teaching in-tune singing.</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b> 
<br>
I have just been looking at the reflective questions on page 16 of <i>Into Music 1.</i> It seems to me that these would be a great starting point to help in the planning process as well as in the review process. They cover the fundamental components for developing a great music programme.</p> 

<p>I am interested to see that children are encouraged to respond to music in different ways including responses to visual art work. Can you explain that a little more for me? I understand how they could respond to the mood of the work. How would you encourage them to respond to the style or the subject, for example?</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b> 
<br>
Yes, Val, these reflective questions are designed for teachers in their planning and evaluation of teaching and learning. Good aren't they!? Says it all really. You ask about visual art responses to music. The last post I gave (not the trumpet version!) might have answered this. It is good to respond to sound in a number of ways and drawing/painting is one. It would be unfortunate if this were seen as the listening programme, and by golly, the visual art to boot. It can be quite therapeutic, though, and in fact, music therapists use guided imagery as a way of helping clients to express themselves &#8211; visualising or drawing to music as pure emotional response &#8211; as it can tell all sorts of personal stories and unpack ways of knowing and seeing the world.</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b> 
<br>
Thank you Merryn. You have given us all a wealth of informative responses to our questions. We could continue quite easily, but we will wind up now as everyone has busy timetables. Thanks to all our participants. We look forward to hearing from you on the next music forum when Merryn will be discussing Chapter 2 of the handbook.</p> 

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b> 
<br>
Well, looks like we've turned down the sound on this "listening" experience. Hope you all stay tuned and join in next session, in tune and in time. Remember to Turn on Your Ears! 
Tune in again to your favourite artsonline music channel on Wed 13 March, same bat time, same bat channel.</p>
