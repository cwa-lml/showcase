<h2 class="h2-forum">National Library Resource &#8211; Discover</h2>

<p><a href="index_e.html">Back to Archived Forum Discussion index</a></p>

<p>Excerpts from forum discussion with Dylan Owen (National Advisor Schools Collection, National Library of New Zealand)<br>
4 September 2002</p>

<p>
<b>Val Duthie:</b><br> 
Kia ora, welcome to our weekly forum. This week our guest online is Dylan Owen, National Advisor Schools Collection, National Library NZ. Our focus this week will be on <i>Discover: Te Kohinga Taonga</i> &#8211; a new online resource for secondary teachers that has been developed to enrich the Visual Arts and Music disciplines of the arts curriculum. See <a href="http://discover.natlib.govt.nz/" target="_blank"></a>. This resource consists of around 2,500 digital items drawn mainly form the National Library's Alexander Turnbull Library Collections. There is a wealth of material here on the work of New Zealand musicians, artists and photographers, both historic and contemporary, M&#257;ori and Pakeha. Find out how you can use this wonderful resource in your school.</p>
<br>

<p><i>How can we access Discover and will it be available for primary schools?</i></p>

<p><b>Tim:</b><br>
I believe that <i>Discover</i> is aimed at supporting the work being done at secondary level. Is that correct? <br>
As I am a primary teacher, I have some questions for you:<br>
1)	How will we be able to access this resource? Is it adaptable for primary use?<br>
2)	Will there be resources that are made available specifically for primary schools?<br>  
3)	If so, when can we expect these to come online? 
</p>

<p><b>Dylan Owen:</b><br>
For the pilot project, <i>Discover</i> was initially focused on the Visual Arts and Music levels 5&#8211;7 but in the future we will be digitising resources to support other levels and learning areas. I certainly believe the range and variety of items that <i>Discover</i> already holds makes it a rich resource for primary schools (and not only in relation to the Arts &#8211; Social Studies is another area that springs to mind) &#8211; from the poster topic which can serve as a stimulus for poster design, to photographs featuring a range of pioneer huts under the Architecture topic.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>What software do we need to download the multimedia items?</i></p>

<p><b>Hans:</b><br>
I see that the site offers around 2500 multimedia items. What software do we need to download these items? </p>

<p><b>Dylan Owen:</b><br>
The only software required is that to view and listen to video and sound clips. All the information you need about how to do this is on the <i>Discover</i> site at: <a href="http://discover.natlib.govt.nz/start.html#tech" target="_blank">http://discover.natlib.govt.nz/start.html#tech</a>. For video you'll need an MPEG video player like QuickTime or Windows Media Player. For sound you'll need a MP3 player like QuickTime or Windows Media Player. Links are given so that you can download the latest versions of the above for free.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>Could you explain what the Discover site is about?</i></p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b><br>
For the teachers who have not yet had the opportunity of looking at the National Library's <i>Discover</i> site, could you explain what <i>Discover: Te Kohinga Taonga</i> has been designed for and outline (in broad terms) the resources that we will find there.</p> 

<p><b>Dylan Owen:</b><br>
Briefly, <i>Discover</i> is a database of items taken and digitised mainly from the Alexander Turnbull Library collections. Currently there are more than 2,500 unique resources available (it's all New Zealand material), including artworks, photographs, posters, manuscripts, music and video clips. Students and teachers can search <i>Discover</i> and find a range of work from artists, musicians and photographers, both historic and contemporary, M&#257;ori and Pakeha. Items can be viewed on-screen and also printed off for classroom use. There is no charge to access <i>Discover</i>. The first curriculum areas to be covered by <i>Discover</i> are the Visual Arts and Music disciplines of The Arts/Ng Toi curriculum levels 5&#8211;7. Under these disciplines a range of topics are presented, including extensive bibliographies of further related resources that teachers may borrow from the National Library.</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b><br>
Your <i>Discover</i> site has "Specialist Advice and Services" listed in its menu. Could you describe some of these services to us please?</p>

<p><b>Dylan Owen:</b><br>
Some of the advice services <i>Discover</i> carries includes: information on copyright, citing <i>Discover</i> items, using <i>Discover</i> in the classroom, some learning examples, how to order copies of images, technical requirements for viewing videos and listening to sound clips, search tips and links to other relevant sites.</p> 

<p><b>Phil:</b><br>
What is the difference between <i>Discover</i> and the items in the National Library's other digital collections?</p>

<p><b>Dylan Owen:</b><br>
<i>Discover</i> items have been selected and presented within a sub-topic, subject and curriculum context, rather than what you would find on, say, <i>Timeframes</i>. Item presentation has also been enhanced in terms of searching and viewing images. This is through the database system that supports <i>Discover</i>, which will also allow us to expand <i>Discover</i> into other learning areas. As well, <i>Discover</i> holds many items that are in copyright and hence are not available via our other digital collections &#8211; for example, most of the music clips.</p>

<p><b>Phil:</b><br>
So <i>Discover</i> is at the early development stage with the intention being to expand this resource to other learning areas. Is that likely to happen next year?</p>

<p><b>Dylan Owen:</b><br>
We certainly want to expand <i>Discover</i> to include other learning areas. This pilot was to test the curriculum online resource concept and discover &#8211; excuse the pun &#8211; what was achievable and what's required to get us up and running. I'd hope we were underway with a new learning area next year. I'd also like to 'top up' Visual Arts and Music with additional sub-topics and items that didn't get in during the first round &#8211; and, of course, there's the other two disciplines to consider, Dance and Drama, but one step at a time I guess. First we need to complete sign up, then evaluate, use, and then look for funding &#8211; digital libraries are surprisingly labour-intensive, and as for copyright...! Personally, given the depth of resources National Library holds, I'd love to see Social Studies as the next learning area selected, and bilingual as well.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>What are the copyright issues?</i></p>

<p><b>Win:</b><br>
I am excited about the material you have on your site. My students will be able to access the site from computers in school. Can students copy music and paintings directly from the site?  Do we have to ask permission from someone to copy these, e.g., you at the National Library? Are there any costs involved?</p>

<p><b>Dylan Owen:</b><br>
I was wondering when I'd get a copyright question! Well here goes. There is extensive information on the <i>Discover</i> site about what teachers can do regarding copyright at: <a href="http://discover.natlib.govt.nz/teacher.html#copyright" target="_blank">http://discover.natlib.govt.nz/teacher.html#copyright</a> and students: <a href="http://discover.natlib.govt.nz/start.html#work" target="_blank">http://discover.natlib.govt.nz/start.html#work</a>. In general, yes, teachers and students can print off <i>Discover</i> images, copy them into projects, etc. (as long as the image is cited and not changed in any way), as well as listen to and play the music and videos. It is not necessary to contact us if, and when, you do this. However if you or a student requires a high quality full-size reproduction of an item, say a poster, it can be ordered from the National Library. There will be a cost but that's to cover the scanning and printing. To order, you need only click on the text "Buy a high-quality copy of this item" which accompanies the image. That's for all items out of copyright. For those items in copyright (apart from one artist), we can supply you with the copyright holder's contact address. Once you get clearance from them we can them, provide you with a quality reproduction.</p>

<p><b>Tim:</b><br>
How do we know which items are in copyright?</p>

<p><b>Dylan Owen:</b><br>
Text accompanying each item when viewed states if it is in or out of copyright. As well, there is a copyright page that gives advice on what can and can't be done with the item.</p> 

<p><b>Win:</b><br>
We are studying multi-layered images at the moment in our art class. What are the issues relating to manipulation of images from your site? Can we use an item as a basis for overprinting, for example?</p>

<p><b>Dylan Owen:</b><br>
Bad news I'm afraid. Unfortunately the Alexander Turnbull library and copyright holders do not allow for manipulation of their images. You can't copy, or alter, or adapt the items in any other way. For example, by manipulating, cropping, overprinting, or colourising an image. However if there was a demand for images that could be manipulated, over-layered, Photoshopped, etc., then we would be happy to investigate this as a topic &#8211; for example, digitising out-of-copyright illustrations from books and magazines. Any thoughts on specific subjects, areas?</p> 

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>Why do we need a login?</i></p>

<p><b>Sheryl:</b><br>
Can you tell me why we need a login for this site?</p>

<p><b>Phil:</b><br>
I was also wondering why we needed a login. Can anyone other than teachers access these resources? If not, why not?</p>

<p><b>Dylan Owen:</b><br>
Sheryl, re. logging in: Logging in is required due to copyright. Many <i>Discover</i> items are in copyright and permission was given to us to digitise them on the understanding that they were to be used within an educational context. Since <i>Discover</i> is on the web and theoretically can be visited by anyone, password access is the way we can uphold current copyright permissions. </p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>Have you had any comment from teachers on the Discover site as it relates to the arts statement?</i></p>

<p><b>Carol:</b><br>
I thought that the information you have assembled on the <i>Discover</i> site relating to the new arts statement was very useful for teachers who are planning units. Have you had any comments or questions from teachers about these pages?</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b><br>
Have these resources been trialled in secondary schools? Which items have been particularly useful for secondary teachers?</p>

<p><b>Dylan Owen:</b><br>
Throughout the project we had a client focus group and testers who provided ongoing feedback and input into presentation, topics, content, etc. The groups were a mixture of primary and secondary teachers. Their feedback (and also feedback from others) indicated that traditional M&#257;ori Arts and Music was going to be very useful, and for some reason everyone thought the Poster topic would be very popular. But overall, the number of unique items <i>Discover</i> offered that couldn't easily be accessed from elsewhere excited teachers.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>Favourable comments on site</i></p>

<p><b>Jean:</b><br>
I have followed the section on Portraits on the site. There is so much excellent material for us there. I will be able to use these portraits for so many things in my class. I personally have learnt heaps by reading the text that goes with each portrait. I loved the way that Jonah Lomu and Lucy Lawless were part of the collection.</p>

<p><b>Hans:</b><br>
Have a listen to the birdsong on the <i>Inspirational</i> site everyone. It's stunning.</p> 

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>Last comment from Dylan</i></p>

<p><b>Dylan Owen:</b><br>
Remember, if you have any feedback or additional questions you can contact me via the <i>Discover</i> feedback form. Also a reminder &#8211; we will be contacting all primary schools about accessing <i>Discover</i> once we have finished registering secondary schools.</p>
