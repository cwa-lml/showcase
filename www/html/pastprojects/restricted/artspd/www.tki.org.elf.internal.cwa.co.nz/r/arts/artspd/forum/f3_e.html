<h2 class="h2-forum">How does drama provide a space for young people to talk about important issues in a safe place?</h2>

<p><a href="index_e.html">Back to Archived Forum Discussion index</a></p>

<p>Excerpts from forum discussion with Peter O'Connor (National Coordinator &#8211; Drama)<br>
10 October 2001</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b><br> 
Our guest this week is Peter O'Connor, National Coordinator for the Arts &#8211; Drama. 
The discussion will focus on the following:</p> 

<p>
<ul>
<li>How might drama be useful for dealing with highly emotive subjects like the September 11 terrorist attacks and their aftermath?</li><br><br>

<li>How does drama provide a space for young people to talk about important issues in a safe environment?</li></ul></P>

<p>Peter has had over 20 years experience in working in drama education. He has taught drama in a diverse range of settings including secure units for juvenile offenders, schools, universities, and polytechnics. He has worked with students in schools, in universities and with special needs groups as well as corporate groups.</p> 

<p>Peter is the author of seven texts on drama education and is currently completing a Research higher degree at Griffith University.</p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor: </b><br>
Kia ora tatou, I guess I'm a little unsure of this technology and I'm hoping that it all works. I'm looking forward to a discussion this afternoon that looks at what drama can offer in working with big issues for kids and in fact of course for us as adults.</p> 

<p>Like everyone else I was shattered by the images of 11 September and disturbed about what they might mean for us as a planet. I no longer work in a classroom, but I wondered about how I would deal with that with my own class and what sort of guidance I might get. My own daughter, who is 14 and is in year 10, was told that there wasn't time in class to discuss the terrorist attacks and so some kids, I guess, were left to attempt to make some meaning out of the events with their peers or parents. </p>

<p>I guess schools can become the preparatory ground for the future as we prepare kids for a future that may or may not happen, and in doing so, we don't give kids what they need now. </p>

<p>My first question before we start with what drama might offer in dealing with big issues, is to ask what you did initially, and now later with your kids, as the planet has unravelled in the last month?</p>

<p><b>Sarina:</b><br>
Kia ora Peter. Often in the past when I have tried to deal with big issues through drama (especially with younger children), they have ended up getting worried about it. What do you suggest I do to avoid this? </p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b><br> 
Kia ora Sarina, I'm glad there's someone out there and started with a juicy hard question! I guess the important thing is that you build the role so that the kids are talking about someone else in a fictional world and then you carefully de-role them so that they are themselves again. For little kids de-roling can be as simple as getting up and having a shake down after the drama. Gavin Bolton who is a British drama teacher talks about "protecting kids into emotion". By that he means that if they build a role they then feel safe to talk about how they feel as if they are that person rather than themselves. It's without that protection that kids feel vulnerable.</p>

<p><b>Sarina:</b><br>  
Thanks for the information about de-roling. I have read a book in the past called <i>The Boy Who Thought He Was a Helicopter</i> and worked in a drama programme based around this in schools in Britain. We used to set a stage within the classroom using masking tape and would tear the tape up together to signal the end of the session. Can you suggest other ways to de-role?</p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b><br> 
Hi Sarina. Yes those physical or ritualistic ways of entering and leaving drama are really important so that kids are very clear about when the drama is happening and when its back to the classroom. Props and costumes and putting them on and off (even if they are mimed rather than real) have the same effect. I also think it's important sometimes to recognise that the traces of the role can linger for some time with kids and adults. I like your physical marking out of the drama space as that can really lead to a ritualised and safety inducing way to start and end drama.</p>

<p><b>Anna:</b><br> 
Hi Peter. Can you tell us about any examples of the ways teachers have used drama to help students express themselves in light of the recent world events?</p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor: </b><br>
Yes people have used a range of different things and I guess we need to recognise that different strategies and approaches are important at different times as the events unfold. In the drama video the Ministry sent to schools there is the use of the story about the billy goats gruff and the trolls. 
Teachers have taken the role of one of the billy goats gruff and refused to go over the bridge because they are scared of the trolls and what they have done in the past. The students in role as other goats have talked about his fears with him, have talked about what it means to go on with life, have sometimes said maybe he's right and should find another way, others have walked him across the bridge. 
Other approaches have seen the teacher-in-role as an angry troll who goes to an anger management class to try and explain why he's angry with the gruffs and the kids in role try to help him with his problems. Often they suggest the two sides sit down and talk. 
In these cases they are talking about the big issues, that is, how do we go about ordinary life when we are scared, and how do enemies become friends but in a safe and protected way through the story and drama.</p>

<p><b>Bridget:</b><br> 
Kia ora all! Bridget here. Sorry I'm a bit late, everyone is docking and I'm looking after the children of the Station. It's nothing strenuous as they are all great children. Anyway what has that got to do with art? Back to the kaupapa. Hi Peter, Sue, Val and all.</p> 

<p>When an issue is raised in the class, it is usually discussed through oral language and question and answer sessions. For those questions where which we don't know the answers we try to find out, either straight away via net, phone, fax, or later on, in role play situations, for example, what if ... what would you do if ....
However, answering an issue through drama sounds really great. The problems I see happening are with the juniors (multi-level class 5, 6, 7, 7, 9, 11, 11), that is, how much is too much information, which issues are too sensitive and better left for parents?  Even if I were to take the older children separately, the juniors would still be able to tune in.</p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b><br> 
Kia ora Bridget. I guess I'm saying that you can make sensitive issues safer by using role and story, although of course you have to know what you can and can't do with the kids you have in front of you. For example, dealing with Cinderella who has problems with her step-sisters is an easy way to deal with the sensitive issue of how reconstituted families get on. How about meeting the step-mum in a drama who I think gets a bum rap in the story and find out why she is so up tight with Cinders.</p>

<p><b>Bridget:</b><br> 
Kia ora ano Peter. I've just read your reply to Sarina &#8211; seems like a direct response to my concerns. Thanks.</p> 

<p><b>He patai: </b><br>
Apart from a production, any suggestions on how can I make drama more exciting and spontaneous for the students? Their teacher is a drama queen and always exaggerates when retelling stories, and I'd like to encourage this in the class. </p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor: </b><br>
Kia ora ano Bridget. The most exciting and fun thing you can do is to jump into the drama with them with you in-role too. There are some nifty ideas about how to do this on the TKI Unwrapping the Arts site (<a href="http://www.tki.org.nz/e/arts/visarts/visarts_home.php">http://www.tki.org.nz/e/arts/visarts/visarts_home.php</a>). Kids will love meeting you as any role you want to be and it's great if you're a drama queen. Also I find doing mystery-type dramas where they have to solve a puzzle or some kind of unanswered mystery works a storm at any age.</p>

<p><b>Bridget: </b><br>
A quick note to let you know that I've got three very fascinated students watching their teacher do online training. The wonders of technology. Todd, Adam and Jacob wish to say hello.</p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b><br> 
Kia ora guys. I'm sitting in my office at home in Auckland sending this to you. Small world eh. No sheep in my backyard but a big golden retriever.</p>

<p><b>Brenda:</b><br> 
Kia ora Peter, I am the online editor for The Arts at TKI. Interestingly enough my 15-year-old daughter suffered the same experience of not having the matters of September 11 addressed in class. This was of much concern to me. I'd like to be able to provide some links and perhaps make some suggestions on the arts homepage. Do you have any suggestions?</p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor: </b><br>
Hi Brenda I will look up some references and links for you. There is an excellent drama that Jonothan Neelands did here in New Zealand about two months ago all about refugees that is a little ripper.</p>

<p>My feeling is that the arts are central to our means of understanding the world in which we live and that, as things happen that we struggle to understand, we need the arts to shape a response to the world. 
Drama always has to be about something and it seems to me that it should be about important things.</p>
