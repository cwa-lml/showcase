<h2 class="h2-forum">How do you make it safe for children to commence an observational drawing?</h2>

<p><a href="index_e.html">Back to Archived Forum Discussion index</a></p>

<p>Excerpts from forum discussion with Ann Brodie (National Coordinator &#8211; The Visual Arts)<br>
6 March 2002</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b>
<br>
Kia ora and welcome to Ann's drawing forum. Our special guest is Ann Brodie, National Coordinator for the Visual Arts. The focus of this forum is "How do you make it safe for children to commence an observational drawing?"</p> 

<p>Activity 1, Page 11 of the Ministry of Education's <i>Printmaking: Exploring the Visual Arts in Years 1&#8211;6</i> will be used as a reference in the discussion, so you may like to have the reference available during the discussion.</p> 

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b> 
<br>
I have thought of five categories we could consider for our topic.</p> 
 
<p><b>Val Duthie:</b> 
<br>
Can you outline for us the five categories you have identified relating to observational drawing? It would be good to unpack what is meant by "observational drawing" as opposed to other methods of drawing. It will be interesting to see if others have additional categories that they would like to discuss.</p>

<p>Ann Brodie: 
<br>
The five areas I thought we should begin with are:</p> 
<ol type="1">
<li>Setting up the room or the object. </li>
<li>What materials are suitable?</li> 
<li>First marks on that blank page.</li> 
<li>How to develop that drawing.</li> 
<li>Resources for teachers. </li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, other areas are fine to consider, too, as they arise. </p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Phil:</b> 
<br>
I'm intrigued by the five categories you have identified, as I had not thought about drawing in this way. My students do draw by observing objects. They use this method to record information when we go on field trips, and sometimes when we are out in the school grounds, too. Can you explain what you mean by setting up the room or the object, as I'm not sure if I am preparing my students well enough for what we are doing?</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b> 
<br>
We are talking about another category of drawing, here. Obviously, you don't set up the great outdoors but you would probably ask the children to select the area they want to draw; that is, use a viewfinder approach. I was thinking of a posed person or still life pet etcetera.</p>

<p><b>Phil:</b> 
<br>
Yes, I can see what you mean. What makes it easier for students when setting up an object inside? Should they have special lighting, or is natural light better? I sometimes give them a viewer to look through as that helps them isolate what they are looking at. We talk about looking very slowly, carefully closely and work at comparing things &#8211; especially the spaces between the shapes. Is that what others are doing?</p> 

<p>It's interesting to see some of the students rushing through the drawing and it's hard sometimes to make them go back and look a bit harder &#8211; to really open their eyes and <b>look,</b> not just imagine what they are seeing. I find that the more often we try this kind of drawing, the more the students get out of it and they get quite proud of all the different parts they can see when they really look.</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie</b>
<br>
I think inside drawings are easier to cope with if you set up a single light source (a desk lamp or an OHP). This makes the position of shadows logical and predictable (if you want to get into shadows). Lots of talking happens; that is great &#8211; the best way to encourage better looking and to give formative comment. Lots of drawing experiences &#8211; a sure way to effect improvement.</p>

<p><b>Chris:</b> 
<br>
Interesting question, Phil: is light an issue? I'm a bit interested in learning styles and have been looking into some of the work by Barbara Prashnig <a href="http://www.clc.co.nz/" target="_blank">http://www.clc.co.nz</a>
<br>
Anyway, my question is how important is light? Or, is light a matter of the learner's preference?</p> 

<p><b>Phil:</b> 
<br>
Chris, I meant to comment on Barbara Prashnig's work, but realise that I may need a refresher. Can you summarise the relevant information for me, as we don't have time to look it up at the moment?</p> 

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Chris:</b> 
<br>
Barbara is not known for her Art (that is not to say she is not an artist). She is the founder of the Creative Learning Company in Auckland. They are involved in learning styles analysis: left and right brain; holistic versus analytical; learning modes etcetera.</p> 

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b> 
<br>
I haven't heard of Barbara Prashnig's work &#8211; who is she? Regarding light: you might not want to even think about that when the children are small &#8211; too complicated. I missed the suggestion that the children select their own light source? I am a bit puzzled by that thought!</p> 

<p><b>Chris:</b> 
<br>
In her celebration of the diversity of learners Barbara identifies light as a factor. Some prefer natural and/or bright light; others prefer dim not-so-well-lit work areas.</p> 

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b> 
<br>
Thanks, Chris. As I am not an Aucklander I have not heard of her.</p>

<p><b>Phil:</b> 
<br>
Chris, yes, good train of thought. You're right, I think, if you are suggesting that it is best to leave the lighting choice for students themselves. Perhaps there may be a difference in the developmental stage of the student though. Some may not be aware of light at all or how that can influence the drawing or the 'seeing'. Do you think that one should support the student, in that case, and offer some guidance?</p> 

<p><b>Chris:</b>
<br>
Honestly Phil, I don't know. On the one hand there is the issue of student preference; on the other, there are the issues of light itself with shading and shadows etcetera. Some of my students (a couple of Year 8s) are so negative, that motivation without a fight is my biggest challenge.</p> 

<p><b>Phil:</b> 
<br>
It's a tricky one isn't it, as it depends on the constraints you are working with &#8211; numbers of children, context of the lesson, culture of the school and all the many other factors impinging upon all of us.</p> 

<p>In an ideal world it would be good to meet the special needs of each one, if we understood them well enough. How to do this within each class is challenging. How do you approach this?</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Chris:</b> 
<br>
Sorry to go off topic but the brief answer is to visit their site <a href="http://www.clc.co.nz/" target="_blank">http://www.clc.co.nz</a> and check out the LSA Junior for primary kids. They are running a special and the analysis is only $10.50 per profile. Next problem is getting something that wasn't in the budget!</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b> 
<br>
Choosing one's own light is not so manageable in an observation-drawing scenario. It doesn't allow for economy of teachers' effort either, or learning from one another, because the problem/principle is different. It's a philosophical approach eh? Choice, or team learning.</p>

<p>The idea of an observation drawing is to draw what you see, so you have to accept the given light source or else set up your own version, as you should make up light effect in a learning-about-reality situation.</p>

<p><b>Chris:</b>
<br>
So, as you stated earlier, a central light is probably best. How do I help learners get the idea of shading and shadows?</p> 

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b> 
<br>
Be a Leonardo and use slanted light .Get the children to squint up their eyes to select just the darkest areas. Next steps are to learn to grade the tone from light, then to decide how to make the marks that describe tone: smudge, dot, and contour etcetera. There's heaps to do!</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b> 
<br>
What materials do you give the children to use, and what level are they? What is the purpose of the drawing?</p>

<p><b>Phil:</b> 
<br>
Well, I often use biros, as they can't be rubbed out. I find it helps to make students more focused and gets them out of the habit of rubbing out.</p> 

<p>In the focus question this week you spoke about a safe environment. I am trying to get the class to feel confident about what they are doing and to accept  "mistakes" as part of the drawing. They don't like drawing over a line, but when I show then that Leonardo could do that, they are slowly getting the hang of it, too.</p> 

<p>Other than that, we have tried pen and ink and we have tried felt tip pens. I didn't find the felt tips so good though, as they seemed to be too quick for the kind of drawing we were doing.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b> 
<br>
Biro makes a beautiful mark and it helps the children not to be too precious about the marks. I suggest with pencil-work that they make as many marks as it takes; that they should be light marks at first; and that they represent thoughts /observations /brain work so they add to the whole. I agree about felts: they are a bit glib &#8211; slidey, and too fast.  Do you give children suggestions as to what to approach first, that is, large shapes small shapes, details? What order?</p>

<p><b>Sue Cheesman:</b> 
<br>
With setting up the classroom, do you suggest that the children are placed around the object so they all get a slightly different perspective, or do you suggest that the object is at one end? I always think of observational drawing with pencils and paper but from your question, I am sure there are other materials to use.</p> 

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b>
<br>
I think it is necessary to be as close as possible to the object if an on-the-table exercise, so around it, is great, with lots of stress on the fact that all viewpoints will be different. 
Regarding materials, it is fun to use fine twigs dipped in ink &#8211; makes a looser mark. But then fine drawing with quality pencils is great, too. The possibilities are endless &#8211; biro is great.</p> 

<p>Had a thought, here: I <b>love</b> printmaking and that is a lovely opportunity to draw negatively: ink up a sheet of card thinly with water-based ink and draw with the tip of a brush handle.</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b> 
<br>
Does anyone have any favourite approaches to that "how do I begin problem?" &#8211; the fear of the white page.</p>

<p><b>Phil:</b>
<br>
Yes, blank pages are really scary. I've noticed that students deal with that by starting way up in a corner somewhere. I ask them to select a spot in the middle of the page and to work out from there &#8211; almost like drawing a spider's web. That helps a bit and it gets the page covered too. </p>

<p>Sometimes we divide the page up into four sections and we do a section of the drawing in each part. I've found that a useful way of generating discussion on different parts of the drawing. I look forward to other ideas.</p>

<p><b>Sue Cheesman:</b> 
<br>
With beginning observational drawing do you suggest starting with large objects? 
Often children do minute drawings. Can you suggest strategies to develop beyond this?</p> 

<p><b>Chris:</b> 
<br>
Give them a big fat wax crayon.</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b> 
<br>
I would tell the children how big a clearly describable area of the picture should be. For example, the head should be about one third of the space. Yes, start with the large shapes then the smaller, and linking ones.</p> 

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b> 
<br>
Do any of you use blind or right side of the brain drawing?  Just in case someone needs to be initiated into this form of drawing, it involves not looking at the page but keeping your eyes on the object/view/whatever. The tip of the pencil trails around the page in response to what is seen by that creative non-measuring right side of the brain.</p> 

<p>The resulting work is charming and sometimes hilarious. Using the wrong hand, but looking, is a similarly interesting technique. Any takers? By the way, if it goes off track the drawer can look at the page, lift the tool, relocate it and continue.</p>

<p><b>Phil:</b> 
<br>
Have you tried a combination of music and drawing? I tried this with some of my class and it worked well. If you get students to recommend their favourite music and then let them draw while it is playing, it helps motivate them. It's a bit of a carrot really, as the only time we play music is when we draw. The pay-off is concentration and no speaking so that we can hear the music; and the other side of the coin is no drawing, no music. We agree on these 'rules' and they really enjoy the time.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Kirsty:</b> 
<br>
I find playing Baroque music and telling the kids it's "brain music" helps create a really positive atmosphere for arts and writing! </p>

<p><b>Phil:</b> 
<br>
Baroque music <b>is</b> good. Do you find that it quietens everyone down?</p>

<p><b>Chris:</b> 
<br>
Some of the more recent classical is good, too. Rather than slowing down to the alpha state there is suggested to be more creativity if Mozart is used.</p> 

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b> 
<br>
I have enjoyed our chat and have heard about some good practice in art teaching from you. Thank you all for sharing. Au revoir and happy drawing.</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b> 
<br>
Thanks Ann, for your responses. We have the beginnings of some very interesting questions emerging and I am sure that some of you may wish to pursue some of these.</p> 

<p>Please feel free to continue posting on this thread, if you wish, as your comments will be helpful to others who read the forum.</p> 

<p>Tina Hong will be responding to dance queries and comments tomorrow between 4&#8211;5 pm. Hope to see you there. Thanks everyone. It's been really enjoyable.</p>
