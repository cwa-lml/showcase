<h2 class="h2-research">Boys and Drama</h2>

<p>by <b>Chris Horne</b>, Auckland College of Education, 2003</p>


<p>Boys in education continues to be a hot topic. This has led educators in many areas to view boys as a distinct group worthy of 
attention. As male teachers, we have seen the value of drama as a tool to enhance boys' learning. As we are primarily 
practitioners rather than theorists, we felt it important to share practical ideas that have worked with boys in our 
own classrooms. However, we also value the place of theory in education and thus have made attempts to theorise our practice 
and practice our theory.</p>

<p>If we accept that gender is not only biologically influenced but is also socially constructed then we need to look at how 
masculinity is constructed. Within New Zealand culture, the male is often seen as the strong silent type, who plays a bit of 
rugby, has a laugh with his mates, but never discusses emotions. If we couple this construct with the high rates of male 
youth suicide and mental health problems, we need to develop ways to challenge this typical construct. That is not to 
say we throw out the rugby, racing and beer, but we broaden our understanding of what it is to be a man. Drama can help us do that.</p>

<h3>The value of drama as a tool to enhance boys learning</h3>

<p>Drama significantly enhances the learning of all students. We have decided to focus on boys in particular because many teachers 
perceive that for their male students, drama will not 'work' - that their boys will be either disinterested or unmanageable or 
both. After many years of teaching drama at the primary and intermediate levels, the reality of our experience is that boys are 
as engaged physically, socially, emotionally, and cognitively as girls and that no valid reason exists for boys not to be 
included productively in drama. We do not want boys to be seen as a problem but rather as learners with particular attributes 
and needs. Some of their attributes include energy, enthusiasm, strength of voice and movement, competitiveness, and assertiveness.</p>

<h3>Why is drama important for boys?</h3>

<p><b>Learning styles</b> is seen as an important reason for why boys should be involved in drama. Research has shown boys preference for 
kinesthetic, spatial, and physical learning styles. Boys are able to grasp new concepts more easily if they are first able to 
physicalise their thoughts and ideas. Drama provides opportunities for this to happen.</p>
   
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Emotional development</b> is an important reason for boys being involved in drama as it has the potential to develop boys' 
emotional intelligence. Gardner (in Armstrong, 1994) has pointed to the importance of developing interpersonal intelligence (the ability 
to make distinctions in the moods, intentions, motivations, and feelings of others). This includes sensitivity to voice, 
facial expression, gesture, and movement. It is through these techniques of drama that students develop their communication 
and interpretation of ideas. Conventions such as hotseating, voices in the head, thought-tapping, conflicting advice, wall 
of thought, collective character, allow students the opportunity to step into the shoes of another and explore and understand 
their emotions, attitudes, hopes, fears, and motivations. We can see drama has a major role to play in developing this 
interpersonal intelligence.</p>

<p>Drama provides the opportunity for boys to explore conflict and tension without using physical violence. Drama enables them 
to create a safe distance from the core event as they move further away in time and space to engage in a variety of roles.</p>

<p><b>Gardner</b> (in Armstrong, 1994) has also pointed to the importance of intra-personal intelligence (self knowledge and the ability to act 
adaptively on the basis of that knowledge). As drama is a deeply reflective process, students are continuously assimilating 
the new understandings and meanings they have made from drama with their present understanding of themselves.</p>

<p><b>Literacy</b> is seen as an important reason for boys being involved in drama as there is a gap between boys and girls literacy 
levels throughout the education system. A reason put forward for this gap has been that some boys see reading and writing 
as predominantly female activities. Drama provides a more meaningful and active context for reading, writing, speaking 
and listening than is offered by more traditional approaches to the teaching of literacy that boys often associate with 
girls and women. In drama, students are often involved in working with others, collaboratively making meaning of their work compared with 
other literacies where students are required to make meaning on their own.</p>

<p><b>Many teachers</b> are looking for ways of developing boys' life skills including social and cooperative skills, self-management, 
competitive and communication. Drama can assist boys to better cope with difficulties they experience dealing with emotions, 
forming and maintaining relationships, handling peer pressure, and discussing, debating, and owning a school's core values 
(instead of becoming disruptive as a protest against these values).</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>The well-structured and safe environment</b> offered in the drama classroom is seen as an important reason for boys being involved in drama. Teachers often 
fear taking drama with boys because they feel they will lose control as the normal classroom structures and routines have been 
altered. However, drama offers boys the freedom to initiate, explore, refine, and share their own ideas within a well structured 
and safe environment. Drama encourages mutual trust, the ability to take risks without getting hurt, and to 'pass' on activities. 
This structure includes clearly defined tasks, responsibilities, time limits, use of space, and appropriate physical and verbal 
behaviour. Drama demands much of individual self discipline and respect for others. In drama, no one loses self-control.</p>

<h3>Guidelines for establishing a safe and structured drama environment</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Work with mixed groups as much as possible within normal classroom routines and drama. It is also often advisable 
	that boys know who they will be working with before the drama starts. Working in groups facilitates risk taking in a 
	supportive, collaborative environment.</li><br><br>
	
	<li>Provide opportunities for boys to take on a variety of roles and responsibilities. Avoid stereotyping and boys 
	dominating decision making. Emphasise that role/character is more important than gender, i.e. what 'drives' a character 
	is what we are exploring, not whether they are male or female. </li><br><br>
	
	<li>Keep instructions brief, clear, and concise to maximise the 'doing'.</li><br><br>
	
	<li>Place limits on physical contact and avoid 'fight' scenes. Do not use a succession of high energy warm-ups. It is important 
	to vary the pace and volume of the lesson and allow time for reflective questions and comments. </li><br><br>
	
	<li>Avoid singling boys out.</li><br><br>
	
	<li>Resolve issues within the drama space &#8211; do not let issues remain unresolved and provide opportunities to 
	de-role when this is necessary.</li><br><br>
	
	<li>Work with ideas that motivate and interest boys. Use their world, their contemporary culture i.e. sport, music, 
	dance, language, visual images, technologies.</li><br><br>
	
	<li>Provide male role models of those who are sporty, artistic, gentle, disciplined, and respectful.</li><br><br>
</ol>
