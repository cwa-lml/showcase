<H2 class="h2-research">Annotated Bibliography for Teacher Professional Development &#8211; Music</H2>

<p><b><i>Kiwi Kidsongs Collection: Twenty-two favourite songs from Kiwi Kidsongs 1&#8211;8.</i> (2000). Wellington: Learning Media Ltd.</b></p>

<p><i>Kiwi Kidsongs Collection</i> is a resource for use in schools. It is a collection of songs written in New Zealand that represent many cultures. Some of these songs were written by teachers, some by children, and some by professional composers. <i>Kiwi Kidsongs Collection</i> is much more than just a singing resource, it provides many opportunities for children to listen, play, move, sing, and create.</p>

<p>A very important aspect of this resource for teachers is that it reflects the aims set out in <i><a href="http://www.tki.org.elf.internal.cwa.co.nz/r/arts/curriculum/statement/contents_e.php">The Arts in the New Zealand Curriculum</a></i> (ANZC). Earlier volumes were aimed at different levels: <i>Kiwi Kidsongs 4</i> was aimed at junior levels; <i>Kiwi Kidsongs 7</i> at senior levels. The latest volumes, <i>Kiwi Kidsongs 10</i> and <i>Kiwi Kidsongs 11</i> have songs for all levels.</p>

<p>The front of the book provides background information about the composer and the music. Incorporating this information into a lesson is a vital part of the strand Understanding Music in Context (<i>ANZC</i>, <a href="http://www.tki.org.elf.internal.cwa.co.nz/r/arts/curriculum/statement/pg54_55_e.php">p. 55</a>).</p> 

<p>Here are some ideas for using the book:
<ul>
<li>Once your children have learned the music, use the backing tracks so you can hear just your children's voices.</li>

<li>Find other songs by the same composer.</li> 

<li>Discuss the similarities and differences between songs.</li>
</ul></p>

	<b>Shehan Campbell, P. &amp; Scott-Kassner. C. (1995). <i>Music in Childhood: from Preschool through the Elementary Grades</i>. New York: Schirmer Books.</b>
</p>

<p>
	This book is a thoroughly reliable source for those teachers wishing to gain an in depth understanding of the musical development of children. The book delineates music and instructional approaches suited to perceptual &#8211; cognitive, physical and effective development of children in early and middle childhood. The various ways in which children manifest their musicality form the basis of a number of chapters: Rhythm and the Child; Pitch and the Child; The Singing Child; and the Creating Child. Natural and incipient musical behaviours associated with child development are noted, and become the backdrop to recommendations for teacher-directed musical experiences and educational sequences.

	<b>Mills, J. (1991). <i>Music in the Primary School</i>. Great Britain: Cambridge University Press.</b>
</p>
	
<p>
	Janet Mills assumes that "Music is for all teachers" but does not assume that every teacher has to be a pianist. She maintains a realistic approach; there must be something that everyone can do. But confidence is paramount.
</p>

<p>
	Part One of the book deals with "Starting Points for Musical Activity" and explores such things as music games, composing music, performing music and purposeful listening to music. Part Two deals with "Developing a Framework" where the discussion centres on research in music development, implications of planning in music, cross-curricular links with music, and extra-curricular music opportunities.

</p>

<p>
	Aspects dealt with in part include: the elements of Orff-Schulwerk: Orff 
media of speech, movement, song, instruments and listening; Orff 
pedagogy and Orff theory. Part Two explores Orff-Schulwerk in practice: a sequence of skills and concepts appropriate for primary classrooms.

<p>
	For a sound understanding of Orff-Schulwerk and its practical application in the classroom &#8211; you can't go past this book.This is the last of three volumes of the American Edition of Orff-Schulwerk. Each volume is divided into three parts:
</p>

<p>
	Part 1 describes a variety of music games intended to help the child develop a feeling for becoming part of a group and to prepare him for a social kind of playing and learning.
</p>

<p>
	Part 2 deals with instrumental playing, speaking and singing and reading
and writing music. 
</p>

<p>
	Part 3 comprises of the publication of a number of articles dealing with such aspects as: Movement; Speech and Song in Early Childhood Music Education; Improvisation and the Young Child; Instrumental Work; Listening Experiences for Young Children; Using Rhymes and Poetry with Young Children; and finally Involving Parents.
