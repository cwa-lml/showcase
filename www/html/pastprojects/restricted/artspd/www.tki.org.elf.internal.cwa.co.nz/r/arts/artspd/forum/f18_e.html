<p>Excerpts from forum discussion with Merryn Dunmill (National Coordinator &#8211; Music)<br>
13 March 2002</p>



<p><b>Val Duthie: </b>
<br>
Welcome to our Music forum with Merryn Dunmill (National Coordinator &#8211; Music) as our guest online. This week, Merryn will be focusing on the subject of singing. Useful background reading for this discussion would be: </p>

<ul>
<li>Chapter 2 of the Music Handbook <i>Into Music! &#8211; Classroom Music in Years 1&#8211;3</i> and<br><br>
</li>



<li><i>Explore Pitch &#8211; Level 1</i>, from The National Exemplars: <i>Singing Pitch Exploration.</i> <br>
<a href="http://www.tki.org.elf.internal.cwa.co.nz/r/assessment/exemplars/index_e.php">http://www.tki.org.nz/r/assessment/exemplars/index_e.php</a>
</ul>


<p>Have a look at the earlier discussion on Listening if you have not already done so. You will find it under the heading "Merryn's Music forum 4pm&#8211;5pm Tuesday".</p> 

<p><b>Alison:  </b>
<br>
My school is a four-teacher school with 84 children. In my classroom of year 1 children, I teach lots of echo songs as greeting and "hello" songs. Have you any resources that would help me expand my repertoire?</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b>
<br>
I looked up Chapter 2 of <i>Into Music 1</i> handbook and saw the introductory statements: "Hutia te rito o te harakeke, kei kea te Komako e ko? If you pluck the centre shoot of the flax bush, where will the bellbird sing?" It goes on to say, "This saying teaches us that, like the bellbird, children need the right environment in which to sing". How do you create the right environment for singing? </p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Kirsty:</b>
<br>
How can you be sure that children are singing in tune if you are not sure that you are?</p>

<p><b>Sue Cheesman: </b>
<br>
With regard to singing how important is posture. I often hear people say sit up or stand up when they are teaching singing. </p>
<p>
 <b>Merryn Dunmill:</b>
<br>
Ok, let's sing. Check out page 30 for resources because there are so many. Check Learning Media in Wellington and <a href="http://www.sounz.org.nz/" target="_blank">www.sounz.org.nz</a> for more resources online. </p>
<p>
Now, environment, Val. You can, and should, sing any time of day. Acoustics are important. Try singing in different spaces, for example outside, in the hall, against a concrete wall, and talk about the differences with the children. Some bounce-back is good but too much confuses the ear. Alison talks about hello and echo songs: great! Sing end-of-day songs, travel safe, celebration songs etcetera. Build events in society into your singing programme so that singing is seen as part of everyday life. Wouldn't it be great to have our future adults travel the world able to sing a song from New Zealand, knowing the words and feeling a strong sense of pride and identity! </p>
<p>
Sing between activities to change routine. Incorporate actions for kinaesthetic learners, and reluctant singers get hooked in as they concentrate on their actions rather than voice, if they are shy about it. Then, they sing naturally with others. </p>
<p>
Always warm up the voice: see the exemplar of Exploring Pitch for ideas. Like any body part the voice needs warming up. Think of your own voice in the mornings when you wake up. It takes time to get it sounding "normal" especially after a bit of a night out!!</p>

<p><b>Alison:</b>
<br>
I like the idea of singing between activities. I find singing helps to create a happy atmosphere. The use of an instrument definitely helps to keep everyone in tune. I have taped myself playing the piano so I have some songs ready for instant action.</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b>
<br>
Looks like the komako has found the flax bush and we are all in tune! Great. Hi Sue and Kirsty, I'm doing multiple responses to catch up with everyone, so please read all. Thanks.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p>
<b>Sue:</b> 
<br>
Posture does impact on the quality of sound and on the ability to control breathing. If you sit scrunched up uncomfortably, the diaphragm that pumps the air can't operate properly and the children end up puffing out short bursts. This is okay for warm ups but when you want to get it sounding better &#8211; for example for a "performance", even it is just "let's stand up, move closer together so you can hear the person next to you" (this helps maintain in-tuneness) &#8211; you will notice an improvement. Play with dynamics (loud and soft, and variations). Play games of getting louder on one note and getting softer on one note (two things happening here are: maintaining pitch, Kirsty; and exploring sound quality (tone colours) of the voice). Work on levels that sound right for the song. </p>
<p>
So, posture should be relaxed shoulders, feet a little apart, and hands at sides if you are performing without movement. With movement, all of that falls into place, for example, kapa haka. Open mouths and make sure the words come through clearly and all together. "S" is a tough sound and usually ends up hissing through: save the "s" until the last minute, that is, hold vowels in preference to consonants. </p>
<p>
Mainly though, for young ones, choose songs in the right pitch or key so they can sing in tune. Choose stronger singers to lead and have others join in, as they feel confident. Always encourage listening to each other and use good tapes if you are unsure of yourself. Stick one finger in one ear and listen to yourself, too, and adjust if you are "out". That's why one-note exercises to small pitch range chants are good &#8211; not too much wobbling around in the early stages. Just like any sport really, one stroke at a time, build on the skills, evaluate and extend. </p>

<p><b>Phil: </b>
<br>
Like everyone else I am always looking for resources. I was checking under TKI search and came up with loads of useful MOE resources on singing. There were also a couple that interested me: </p>
<ol type="1">
<li><i>The Underwater Melon Man and Other Unreasonable Rhymes</i> suitable for levels 1&#8211;5 of the New Zealand curriculum; and<br><br>
</li>

<li><i>Horrible Songs for children:</i> <i>Fat cat</i> and <i>Fish face</i> written by two anonymous New Zealand composers who make cheeky songs for older children.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Can you tell us anything about these resources and how they could best be used? </p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b> 
<br>
Yes, both are great resources and the kids love them. <i>The Underwater Melon Man</i> is on in the New Zealand Festival of the Arts in Wellington at present and has been a huge success for all ages. The CD and book is readily available from bookstores such as Whitcoulls and the CD from CD stores across the country. </p>

<p>You can use any resource in any way that suits your classes, of course, as listening and discussing, as motivation for other learning activities, as songs to re-create, or as text to play with and write original songs (or vice versa). We have a wealth of resources to select from and more on the way. <i>Kiwi Kidsongs11</i> will be out soon; another Pacific Island songbook, CD, CD-ROM and resource book of New Zealand contemporary rock music, and so on. Watch for advertising in your school.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Carol: </b>
<br>
One of the things we strive for, as a rural school in Northland, is to encourage our Kapa Haka group to sing in two-part harmony. </p>

<p><b>Phil:</b>
<br>
I'm also interested in Carol's question about two-part harmony. Do you have any comments on that?</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b>
<br>
You need to build up to singing in parts, although many students do this naturally as a part of their community and family life, which shows how important the environment is to learning to sing.</p>

<p>With students who have had little or no experience of singing outside of the bathroom or along with tapes in their bedrooms, lots of unison stuff first is the best plan: then rounds so they learn to hold a part against another, then to part-singing &#8211; holding a different part at a different pitch. This is great for seniors, especially, who like the challenge and the sound produced.  </p>

<p>Again, all those <i>Kiwi Kidsongs</i> songbooks offer a range of songs for this. Beatles songs and 60's music in general have good part-singing in them: simple harmonies, predictable and fun to sing and play along with. </p>

<p>Some students will struggle with part-singing and it takes independent group practices to make it strong and confident. They simply have to learn to listen to the strongest person on their part and hone in on their pitch. Drawing pitch in the air can help. Have two parts stand in groups in different spaces in the room. Get them to make eye contact with each other and follow a confident and accurate leader's pitch drawing (by hand movements) in the air. Sometimes this tactile approach reaffirms the aural. Try one group soft and one loud and then swap. Try getting them to walk around the room randomly singing their part. This is hard and a real test of accuracy at the end.</p>

<p><b>Ann N:</b> <br>
I am very interested in the questions and answers so far, providing me with many varied ways to explore. My question is, when discussing singing how does rap fit? My children love to rap and are really interested in this. How do I help them? </p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b>
<br>
Rap is a distinct style of music with particular techniques and meanings. Often it is taken as anything chanted and often dealt with badly: for example, no syncopation or repeated words or no sense of what rap should really sound like. Kids take badly to teachers trying to teach rap and ending up doing a very "classical" chant. So, if the kids are into it, then they are likely to be the best ones to lead it. </p>

<p>You can help by playing good quality and okay (check lyrics) rap in class and talking about it: how it has been put together: rhythmic pattern: use of voice etcetera. It's a great art form and hip-hop, in particular, has grown out of the Rap movement and is a big music industry in New Zealand. It's quite unique, particularly the Pacific feel, for example, Nesian Mystic, Sheelahroc and so on. </p>

<p>
Record the kids' work and they can DJ or scratch over the recording by using a turntable (called turn-tabling and a legitimate art form in its own right). Hip Hop has catchy hooks and choruses to sing along to and is a dance style, so moving to it is important, too. There are plenty of videos around and TV is a good source of inspiration too. </p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Chris: </b><br>
Where is the best place to start developing a school wide implementation plan for music? 
</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b>
<br>
Your question is enormous, and a long-term thing. School wide implementation has to come from shared goal setting and understanding of the curriculum. The four strands, the levels and the range of contexts are all critical across the school. Regular, ongoing music learning needs to be planned for throughout the (dare I say) week, if not each day. </p>

<p>In the early years it is so naturally part of all learning: language development through song; rote learning through song; mathematical understanding through rhythm work; discussion of contexts is social studies; creative work is technology and health. </p>

<p>All the essential skills are embodied in every music activity: social cooperative (working in cooperative learning groups totally uniquely in music, as all have to work together and listen and respond simultaneously in a distinct language beyond words for success to occur); problem-solving (for example, creating an original piece of music, working out how to play an instrument); numeracy (counting beats and rhythms, reading notation; literacy (reading text, reading notations); communication (through performance of songs and instrumental music and through discussing and analysing what is heard); study skills (through independent rehearsal and discipline etcetera). It is interesting that employers prefer to take on employees who have studied music, as they are advanced in all these skills compared with others. </p>

<p>Whatever, the plan needs to incorporate listening, singing, playing, creating, reading and representing, and analysing opportunities for a good holistic programme. You will note that music-strong schools have focused, high achieving students who want to be at school and to learn: sometimes that's all they come to school for. </p>
<p>
That sounds passionate but there is loads of international and national research to back all of the above and I am interested in the number of Decile 1&#8211;3 primary, intermediate and secondary schools setting themselves up with music academies. Good vibrations indeed!</p>

<p><b>Chris:</b>
<br>
Can anyone suggest suitable songs for competent singers who have a non-confident teacher. I make a joyful noise with juniors as the "wheels on the bus go round," and we go "gallop like the little green frog," accompanied by my out-of-tune guitar. </p>
<p>
My senior students have done a lot of high brow acapella with a talented lady in our community but as for singing for enjoyment and learning songs that they want, I'm not sure where to start. </p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p>
<b>Val Duthie:</b>
<br>
Chris, would you like to share some of your experiences with us? I think I am right in thinking that your students have the opportunity to sing in the Waitomo Caves with other singers? That must be such an amazing experience. The acoustics there would be so different. The environment is so beautiful and the opportunity to sing with others in that scenario is very special.</p>

<p><b>Christine:</b>
<br>
The community member Chris mentioned before helping with our music programme has perfect pitch and sounds absolutely beautiful in the cave. She helps me in the classroom with singing on the days she is helping in the classroom. </p>

<p><b>Chris:</b> 
<br>
Yes Val, it is an awesome experience. The children sing unaccompanied, sometimes on their own, other times with the adult choir. Last June, we went to Auckland and were involved in the production of a CD. You can imagine that with having such a hard act to follow, one might feel a bit anxious trying to twang away a new tune in a croaky untrained voice. </p>
<p>
The acoustics in the cave are amazing, the atmosphere in the Cathedral electric. The lights go out and from far away a soprano voice begins "Once in royal David's city". The lights begin to come up and the lone soloist is joined by a 40-strong choir for the second verse. Three months practice for three nights performance. It is quite something... </p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b>
<br>
Just reading about your experience with singing in the caves has sent shivers through my spine. Your students have the opportunity that most can only dream about. All the practice is worth it &#8211; even for one opportunity to sing there. </p>
<p>
I have heard of folks playing the violin in the centre of the pyramids: singing in the caves is certainly in that league. </p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b> 
<br>
Sounds like you are having fun. If the kids have done acapella work with an expert then there will be leaders among them who can take a song with parts or make part-singing happen through their own versions of songs. Check out Barbershop ideas too, because these can be adapted and changed to suit different songs. <i>Into Music 2</i> and <i>3</i> will be out next year for years 4&#8211;6 and 7&#8211;10 respectively and there will be lots more ideas and resources listed there. </p>

<p><b>Ann N:</b>
<br>
Thanks for the advice with regard to rap. I am certainly happy to leave it to the kids and support them in this activity. Thanks for the further suggestions. Singing in a cave sounds great</p>



<p><b>Christine:</b>
<br>
I am interested in the resource called <i>Beat Circle</i> created by Max Stewart. Have you heard of it? I was wondering how valuable you considered this resource.</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b> 
<br>
The <i>Beat Circle</i> is an adaptation from the idea first used in <i>Upbeat</i> (an Australian music kit for each level of their curriculum and very good to adapt from). I have seen Max's version and think it is colourful and fun.</p>

<p>You can do this yourself by simply drawing different symbols on the board in a circle &#8211; 3 for three beats and 4 for four beats etcetera. Point to each beat in the circle and have an action (and one silence) for each symbol. Then put music on in the time/metre you have symbols for and point away in any order to keep everyone on the job. This is lots of fun and a student can come up and be the conductor pointing around the circle, back and forth, repeat one action over and over &#8211; lots of fun and guaranteed to have the whole class on task and alert! </p>


<p><b>Val Duthie:</b>
<br>
Thanks everyone for joining us and for sharing some of your thoughts and questions. We hope you will join us next week for the drama forum and in the new term when Merryn will be online again.
