      <h3>Introductions</h3>
      <p><strong>Sarah Wilson:</strong><br>
        This week we are talking about Nga Mahi a te Rehia &#8211; Maori Performing 
        Arts with Rawiri Hindle and Jojo Rangihaeata. Both guests have a wealth 
        of experience in this field so look forward to some excellent discussion 
        around this subject. </p>

      <li><p><strong>Rawiri Hindle</strong> is the Ministry of Education&#8217;s National 
        Coordinator for Nga Toi and a lecturer at the Wellington College of Education. 
        He is also the Maori Content Coordinator for Te Kete Ipurangi where he 
        assists with developing materials for Maori language teachers in the general 
        stream and for those working in the Maori immersion Kura Kaupapa schools. 
      </p></li>
     <li> <p><strong>Jojo Rangihaeata</strong> is a Maori Web Developer for Te Kete 
        Ipurangi and a highly experienced kapa haka performer. Here she introduces

        I was a little girl in the Patea Maori Club, and since moving back to 
        Gisborne and doing kapa haka all my life. I have competed at in regional 
        kapa haka level for about 10 years, and have competed in the nationals 
        for nine years. My life's passion is evolved around kapa haka and anything 
        Maori. I live and breath anything Maori and especially my own native tongue 
        and of course Nga mahi a te Rehia (performing arts). </p>

      <p><strong>Sarah Wilson:</strong><br>
        Kia ora and welcome Rawiri and Jojo! </p>
      <p><strong>Carol Langton:</strong><br>
        Tena korua Rawiri and Jojo <br>
        Welcome to the forum and thanks for taking the time to share your experience 
        and knowledge with us today.</p>
      <p><strong>Rawiri Hindle:</strong><br>
        Kia ora koutou </p>
      <p>Nga mihi nui kia koutou me nga ahuatanga o te ra. Ko te whakatauaki ki 
        toku hinengaro i tenei wa &quot;Ko tou rourou, ko toku rourou ka ora ai 
        te iwi.&#8221;</p>
      <p>Greetings to you all and to the circumstances of the day &#8211; whatever 
        they may be. The proverb that comes to mind for this session makes reference 
        to the fact that what you have to offer and what I have to offer brings 
        sustenance to the people.</p>
      <h3><br>
        Topic: Help with mau rakau actions</h3>
      <p><strong>Julie Lawson:</strong><br>
        Tena korua Rawiri, raua ko Jojo. Naumai haramai ki tenei wahi 'Ipurangi'. 
      </p>
      <p>Looking forward to this afternoon, and need help with mau rakau actions 
        for a battle scene in our forthcoming end-of-year production. Heoi ano</p>
      <p><strong>Jojo Rangihaeata:</strong><br>
        Julie, if you know any men in a kapa haka group near you who would be 
        willing to help, I&#8217;m sure that it wouldn't be a problem. </p>
      <p><strong>Rawiri Hindle:</strong><br>
        Kia ora Julie<br>
		Thanks for your question &#8211; big one really. There's no step by step 
        process for what you're looking at &#8211; there's just what you already 
        know, and seeking out and working with someone (obviously in your area) 
        who has knowledge in mau rakau to support you with your vision. Another 
        possibility that you may already have explored is to find out if your 
        students can help you. Good luck!! </p>

      <h3>Topic: Maori content in national qualifications </h3>
      <p><strong>Carol Langton:</strong><br>
        I have been surfing for web links, and found this is the NZQA one:<br>
        <a href="http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/for-maori/publications/akk/akk-03/kapa-haka.html">http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/for-maori/publications/akk/akk-03/kapa-haka.html</a> 
        Did you know there are 96 items found under Kapa Haka on the NZQA site?! 
      </p>
      <p>Click on this <a href="http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/framework/explore/field-maori.do;jsessionid=68838674">link</a> 
        to find information about the Maori Framework Search, and unit standards 
        and national qualifications with Maori content </p>
      <p><strong>Jojo Rangihaeata:</strong><br>
        Kia ora for that Carol! It&#8217;s just really nice to get our culture 
        out there in the open whether it be traditional or contemporary. </p>
      <h3><br>
        Topic: Breadth of Nga Mahi a Te Rehia</h3>
      <p><strong>Rawiri Hindle</strong>:<br>
        Nga Mahi a Te Rehia is a huge area &#8211; not just kapa haka. It covers 
        areas such as whaikorero (speech making), karanga (the call in the context 
        of powhiri), welcome ceremonies, mau rakau, stilt walking, puppetry, dance, 
        stick games, string games, drama, performance... </p>
      <p>Kapa haka components include waiata a ringa (action songs), poi, haka, 
        waiata tawhito (chanting, entrance and exits on to stage).</p>
      <h3><br>
        Topic: Impact of waiata and kapa haka</h3>
      <p><strong>Tom Evans:</strong><br>
        Tena kotou. Good to be online again! </p>
      <p>Friends at the Australian conference were very moved by a waiata from 
        Taranaki &#8211; even on the lips of a Welshman like me, te reo calls 
        to many cultures. We need more of it in our schools and reflected in our 
        lives and our practice.</p>
      <p><strong>Rawiri Hindle:</strong><br>
        Ae tika!! I agree totally &#8211; there's something very special about 
        performing waiata. I'm constantly moved by the expression of kapa haka, 
        and I think it's to do with the fact that everything is involved: voice, 
        sound, movement, gesture. And then there&#8217;s the inward emotions being 
        projected to the listening audience. </p>
      <p>I also love the fact that more and more people/students are learning 
        and performing waiata &#8211; for the fact that that the expression is 
        rooted in the environment and connects to where we live in this great 
        big world! </p>

      <h3>Topic: Finding inspiration and help</h3>
      <p><strong>Norma Hubbard:</strong><br>
        At present there are no Maori performing arts within our school. I have 
        included it in the long-term plan that I am completing and would like 
        to know where to find simple resources that might inspire other teachers 
        for its inclusion.</p>
      <p><strong>Jojo Rangihaeata:</strong><br>
        Norma, my old high school in Gisborne is one of the first schools to bring 
        performing arts in a an academy. There are a few other academies now at 
        Lytton High, and the performing arts one seems to be soaring to higher 
        heights.</p>
      <p>Also, my brother at Dannevirke High School is also trying to starts a 
        performing arts academy for the kids. So if you want details, I can post 
        some up for you.</p>
      <p><strong>Norma</strong>:<br>
        Thanks Jojo! Any assistance I can get would be helpful. I don&#8217;t 
        know how far I&#8217;ll get with my ideas, but I have the full support 
        of the Te Reo teacher, which is a great help.</p>
      <p><strong>Carol Langton:</strong><br>
        Jacinda Gilligan from Lytton High is on The Arts Online roll. I can contact 
        her for further details if you are interested. Even though it is a high 
        school, there are often good protocols that would suit a primary school 
        year 1&#8211;8 programme like yours, Norma.</p>
      <p>As far as resources go, Rawiri, are there any inspirational videos we 
        can suggest?<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Rawiri Hindle:</strong><br>
        There are links to Mahi a te Rehia resources on TKI in Nga Toi Online 
        in the Mahia te Rehia section under 'Kohinga rawa whakaako' then 'Nga 
        Rauemi kua puta.' </p>
      <p><strong>Norma:</strong><br>
        Thanks for the ideas and help, and the directions to useful sites. I will 
        carry on with my plans, and make contact with anyone who can help.</p>
      <p>I look forward to the next forum &#8211; they are always very helpful 
        and informative.</p>

      <h3>Topic: Getting started, keeping going</h3>
      <p><strong>Tom Evans:</strong><br>
        Hi Norma! Over the years teaching in an Intermediate school I have seen 
        many attempts at teaching kapa kaka. Some have been very successful, and 
        the children and school community have benefited greatly. </p>
      <p>But the experts are in short supply and there is an immense call upon 
        their time and energy. Nurturing and valuing these precious people and 
        supporting them in what can be a foreign environment seems essential. 
      </p>
      <p>At the moment one of our teachers belonging to South Taranaki is doing 
        a crash course to help the school and the children she obviously loves 
        and cares for. I hope she does not burn out. It is great to see her practice 
        poi any time she has a moment &#8211; her enthusiasm is infectious.</p>
      <p><strong>Rawiri Hindle</strong>:<br>
        Ki ora Tom!<br>
        Great to hear that your teachers is so onto it, and, yes, it is important 
        to watch the burn out thing. Its very inspirational that she&#8217;s so 
        into it and often the inspiration aspect is infectious &#8211; be great 
        if it rubs off onto some of the other staff!</p>
      <h3><br>
        Topic: Integrating the disciplines</h3>
      <p><strong>Sarah Wilson:</strong><br>
        Mona, it&#8217;s great that you could make it! Have you got anything you 
        would like share with us about the arts at your school?</p>
      <p><strong>Mona:</strong><br>
        Well, that's a biggy! We had our first big go at integrating all the disciplines 
        in the arts and tying up our cultural representation within the school 
        (Maori/European) into what we called &#8216;Stars in their Eyes&#8217;. 
        We thought it was great and the kids enjoyed the term, and the spin-offs 
        have been great.</p>
      <h3><br>
        Topic: Virtual marae</h3>
