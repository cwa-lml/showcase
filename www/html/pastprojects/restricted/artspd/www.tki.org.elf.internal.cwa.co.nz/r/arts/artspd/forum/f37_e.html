<h2 class="h2-forum">Into Music 2 &#8211; Classroom Resource</h2>

<p><a href="index_e.html">Back to Archived Forum Discussion index</a></p>

<p>Excerpts from forum discussion with Merryn Dunmill (National Coordinator Music)<br>
11 September 2002</p>

<p>
<b>Val Duthie:</b><br> 
Kia ora, welcome to the music forum with Merryn Dunmill (National Coordinator &#8211; music) as our guest online. The focus this week is on the Ministry of Education's new music curriculum support material for teachers, <i>'Into Music 2'</i> that is aimed at years 4&#8211;6. We will be discussing chapter 1, 'Listening' (pages 5&#8211;20 of <i>'Into Music 2'</i>) as well as the music on the accompanying CD. This is a wonderful opportunity to get expert support in understanding the potential of this new material. So we hope you will join in the discussion and share some of your ideas with us.</p>

<p><i>How does Into Music 1 relate to Into Music 2?</i></p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b><br>
I think it would be helpful to place this material in context. So, can you outline for us:  1) the aim of this new support material for teachers and 2) how <i>'Into Music 1'</i> relates to <i>'Into Music 2'</i>.</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b><br>
The aim of the resource is to serve as a user-friendly guideline to classroom music practice. It reinforces the learning from earlier years as described in <i>Into Music 1</i> and builds in a spiral way on that learning. Always revisit key learning and extend it... like aural memory. The skills and knowledge bases are building blocks and in a smallish resource such as this many aspects are covered, not all. As many sound ideas are presented as is practicable. There are of course hundreds of approaches to teaching music and so much depends on the needs of the students. Teachers need to select, develop, refine and reflect on the guidelines ensuring that the range of abilities, experiences and backgrounds of the students are catered for. Music can do this so well as it touches on the hearts and souls of our community. <i>Into Music 1</i> grows into <i>Into Music 2</i> which in turn will be seen to grow into <i>Into Music 3</i>... that you will see in 2003! Hope that kind of answers the questions. Layout, structure is clearly similar and if you check out the learning outcomes across the 2 guidelines you can clearly see progression in learning. This is a really good exercise to do for each chapter and can be a strong basis for planning your music programme.</p>

<p><i>Suggestion for finding copies of Into Music 1 or 2</i></p>

<p><b>Carol:</b><br>
What do you tell teachers who say they can't find the resource?</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b><br>
<i>Into Music 1 or 2</i>: These curriculum support materials go to every primary school, more than one copy, and somebody is hiding them! Wouldn't it be sensible if schools had a policy of putting new resources in the staff&#8211;room for the first week they arrive, for all to see but not remove, then they go to the teachers. At least then everyone knows of their existence. More copies can be ordered from Learning Media if needed of course. Believe me, they are there and are precious. So seek and ye shall find.</p>

<p><b>Judy:</b><br>
We give teachers a list of all the main Learning Media material that has been issued. One of their tasks between 'cluster days' is to find them all. We also encourage them to do a 'stocktake' of all the resources in their schools &#8211; they are amazed at what comes out of classrooms! We encourage them to get the 3 extra copies of <i>'Into Music'</i> that they are entitled to from Learning Media and extra copies of other useful Learning Media material. We asked them to let whoever receives the mail in their schools know that something new was expected and to share it during staff meetings. We suggested an 'arts bite' at each syndicate/staff meeting for different teachers to show a resource, share an idea, show a piece of artwork etc. This has been working really well.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>How Into Music 1 and 2 are used</i></p>

<p><b>Robyn:</b><br>
I have used the track <i>'Here We Go'</i> from <i>Into Music 2</i> CD &#8211; it's great for movement, echo-clapping etc &#8211; lots of different 'warm-ups.'</p>

<p><b>Judy:</b><br>
Some teachers have found the listening tracks too long for children to listen to &#8211; best to break each of them into sections and should be listened to a number of times.</p>

<p><b>Judy and Robyn:</b><br>
It's vital that teachers remember that <i>Into Music 2</i> is aimed at children in years 4&#8211;6 and should build on <i>Into Music I</i>. If children (and teachers) aren't ready for this, they should start with <i>Into Music I</i>. Another point &#8211; we discourage teachers of year 3 children, for example, of using all the <i>Into Music 2</i> material because they aren't usually ready to cover the content in depth and it doesn't leave fresh material for years 4&#8211;6 teachers. We love the references made to Kiwi Kidsongs &#8211; e.g. <i>'Homework Blues'</i> as an example of music in rock style &#8211; this gives another tangent for teachers to pursue with their children.</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b><br>
Yes, taking some tracks in sections, fading out, coming back to it later in the day, but build up that tolerance cause ads have conditioned kids to 30 second bites. This is a concern as we expect them to listen in class all day! Music listening, focused listening, developing the aural skills and ability to concentrate are all important societal attributes and needed more than ever in today's world.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>How do you simplify the games and develop aural memory?</i></p>

<p><b>Carol:</b><br>
Regarding the <i>Simon Says</i> game in the Listening chapter of <i>Into Music 2: eight beat patterns</i> are sometimes difficult to remember. Do you have any suggestions for simplifying this game and developing aural memory?</p>

<p><b>Maria:</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Idea for 'Noughts and Crosses' that works well. </li> 
<li>Use snippets of popular artists' songs as clues e.g. Goodshirt, Che-Fu, Hinewehi Mohi, Six, Moby, J-Lo... </li>
<li>Possible questions: name the song, name the group, name the lead singer, where is this group from? </li> 
<li>This is a great 'turn on your ears' game.</li>
</ul>

<p>Merryn Dunmill:
<i>Into Music 1</i> considered playback of one bar (4 beat patterns) as echoes and by years 4&#8211;6 and all those previous experiences students are well able to remember short 2 bar or 8 beat patterns. To warm up though, start with simple one-bar patterns and try in different metres e.g., 3 beats in a bar. Then do a two bar pattern with the first bar always a straight 4 crotchet walking steady beat pattern then the next bar can add rhythmic variety. This way, the first bar is constant but establishes the beat firmly. Finally, when that is successfully mastered, try 2 bars of different rhythms for the class to echo back. Students who are good at this make great leaders and can have turns at leading the class through a sequence. You don't have to include the forbidden pattern idea (which I do simply by saying 'if I do the same pattern twice in a row, i.e. a second time after you do it, don't clap'... keeps them on their toes. Then those who are are 'out' can sit down and try to write the patterns they hear to keep them challenged if reading music is being taught. Use different body parts to change the sound and maintain interest and aural discrimination.</p>

<p><i>How important is it to use correct terminology?</i></p>

<p><b>Sheryl:</b><br>
There is guidance about giving children the opportunity to talk about and respond to performances. I liked the open-ended questions suggested in the book to help generate appropriate responses. How important is it to use 'correct' musical terminology with the children e.g. mood, timbre, dynamic etc. Do you think that children should all be using this terminology at this stage?</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b><br>
I do believe children should be using the language at this age and before. They are only words to save using lots of words and kids pick them up as long as they hear them and relate them to the context. Often it is we adults who avoid terminology when children accept it readily, e.g. If it is getting louder the dynamics are changing &#8211; a question for the teacher to ask is 'how are the dynamics changing?' If this is a new word then it needs to be reiterated with the addition of 'is the volume changing as the music progresses? How?'... 'Yes, the dynamics are changing and the music is getting louder &#8211; reinforce the language so it becomes the norm. Look at how easily children learn new languages... and perhaps how poorly we do as adults. Our job is to deconstruct, reconstruct, relate and reinforce.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>How can we help students focus their research using the Internet?</i></p>

<p><b>Phil:</b><br>
One of the many activities suggested to help broaden children's listening experiences is Internet research. With such a range of Internet music sites available, can you suggest how we can help children focus their research? Should we select sites for them for example?</p>

<p><b>Bob:</b><br>
I found this website &#8211; The Celestial Jukebox, <a href="http://www.listen.com/" target="_blank">http://www.listen.com/</a></p>

<p>It says that it is:<br>
<i>'Simple, fast, and reliable, Rhapsody gives you unlimited access to one of the largest digital music collections in the world. Listen to complete albums. Create custom play lists. Play what you want, when you want. Rhapsody is the leading music subscription service that gives you unlimited playback of your music. Combine that with Internet radio and in-depth artist info, and you've got the one service that does it all. When you sign up for the Rhapsody All Access catalog at $9.95 per month, you can play as much CD-quality music as you want whenever you want. No limits, no restrictions &#8211;&#8211; plus over 50 commercial-free radio stations and engaging artist information'.</i></p>

<p>So it's a cost to the school, but seems to have a large collection of music to choose from. Have you any comment to make about a site like this. Is it worth pursuing, or is there more reliable ways of accessing a wide range of music to listen to?</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b><br>
Yes, definitely guide students to appropriate sites. Check out <i>Teaching and Learning Materials on TKI Unwrapping the Arts Music</i> &#8211; there is a huge list of sites for you to have a look at first and all hot-linked for ease. Others, especially for you and older students, i.e. that are educational (great for research) and NZ based are: <br>
<a href="http://www.noizyland.com/" target="_blank">www.noizyland.com</a> &#8211; indie and pop music and links to every kiwi band website <br>

<a href="http://www.bands.co.nz/" target="_blank">www.bands.co.nz</a> &#8211; independent bands, forum, gig guide <br>
<a href="http://biggie.co.nz/" target="_blank">http://biggie.co.nz</a> &#8211; dance music, electronica <br>
<a href="http://www.sergent.com.au/nzmusic" target="_blank">www.sergent.com.au/nzmusic</a> &#8211; 60s and 70s kiwi music <br>

<a href="http://www.nzmusic.org.nz/" target="_blank">www.nzmusic.org.nz</a> &#8211; NZ Music Industry Commission site about industry </p>

<p>These are good because they support our artists. </p>

<p><i>What sort of questions would you ask to lead students to graphic mapping?</i></p>

<p><b>Christian:</b><br>
I've just been listening to the CD. There are lots to keep me going in the class with the range of music on there. In the book under <i>'Ki te la'</i> on page 6, it shows how children can graphically map changes in texture such as sparse to thin and busy to layered, etc. Can you give me an example of the kind of questions you would ask children about <i>'Ki te la'</i> that would lead to graphic mapping? </p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b><br>
Page 11, <i>Into Music 2</i> gives some good focus questions that suit any piece. You need to draw out what they hear. Students can work in groups to decide on this without teacher direction actually. They can listen to a section of the music and each draw what they hear as the music plays. They then discuss and share with their peers... it is likely each student will have heard different things, and some of the same, and will have interpreted in graphics in their own way. Explaining their work to others and maybe deciding as a group which ideas work best and why, then making a group score/map, is a fun and challenging activity. It certainly helps steer those who take time to pick up on what is required, empowers everyone in the group, and highlights group decision-making and individual and group problem solving. Each group can then trade their scored section with another group who may have worked on a different section of the music, if you have another space and audio gear for them to work from. They try to re-perform each other's scores and evaluate its successes and challenges. More decision-making and goal setting! In the end, it's about how to listen, how to respond in whichever ways that are most appropriate to your students, the music etc.</p>

<p><i>How important is it that students understand the context of the music?</i></p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b><br>
The teaching examples give us information about the composer, his/her musical influences, why he/she composed music and the underlying intention of his/her music. This is followed by a description of the music itself e.g., orchestral, written for ballet, about cowboys and girls, and how hoe-down (the title of the piece) was relevant, finally a summary of the 3 sections of the piece. At last I come to the question. How important is it that children understand the context of the music they are listening to?</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b><br>
It is very important. As in Visual Arts, there needs to be a source of motivation, a connection with real people in the real world so that we can make our own works of art. In this sense listening and understanding who made the music, why, where, when and how heighten that understanding. Allow students to see they too could be composers and that music is important in so many ways... telling stories, depicting scenes, making points, shaping views, producing moods and making us feel in response. The difference between <i>Imbal Imbalan</i> and <i>Ki te La</i> for example says so much about worlds of experience of the composers and performers, the countries, the smells, tastes, look, feel of a place etc. Helps us understand the world we live in and understand better who we are and what we enjoy/need to express ourselves in new ways... unthreatening, universal language ways that break all those nasty boundaries. </p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b><br>
We never really know how anybody hears music. It's not possible to get inside heads and read the responses. Questioning to draw out ideas is therefore critical as is playing back short musical ideas in the music, writing a response based on key/focus directions, composing an idea similar to one heard in the music etc. These are ways of interpreting how people have heard music &#8211; <i>'Try playing this drum the way you hear it here.'</i> Repeated listenings are important to give people time to consolidate &#8211; assessment is formative and happens over time. Chunking the learning, through focused listening, short aural memory games, composition tasks and performance ones too, these are all legitimate ways of assessing.  Not all students use words well to describe and identify and respond to sound. Practical application is actually even more revealing and more real in terms of being a musician. Music critics, CD cover writers et al of course are expert with words! There are so many jobs out there for our good listeners.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>Focused and background listening</i></p>

<p><b>Carol:</b><br>
Listening &#8211; Turn On Your Ears &#8211; Chapter One: <i>'Listening is a fundamental aspect of the music discipline... As a teacher you need to plan listening experiences...'</i> I have always found this aspect of teaching music to be a great way to build up to a true and meaningful experience. Children aren't used to listening with intent. They live in a world of sounds &#8211; multi-sounds &#8211; and they absorb it all as a texture or background to their busy lives. This is the teachers' challenge; to get children to listen with intent. <i>'Into Music 2'</i> addresses this challenge extremely well.</p>

<p><b>Jean:</b><br>
Can you explain the difference between focused listening and background listening? I'm not too sure if I clearly understand what is meant by 'focused.' When it comes down to it, I'm not sure of 'quality' either. It says that we should ensure that there is a 'quality' sound system available for listening sessions.</p>

We are building audiences of the future as well and it is valid to love music as a listener only &#8211; my partner is such a person who has made music his life but never performed or composed. He has worked in the music industry all his working life and is very knowledgeable. He knows more about who and what, where and when than me... not the why or how though! Focused listening is about guiding the students to zero in on an element or feature &#8211; minimalise if you like so that they learn to listen for specific things e.g., listen for the instruments and put your hand up when you hear an oboe. Background listening is not guided or focused, it is for feeling and enjoying without the thinking and analysing necessarily. Some will always do the latter if they are astute and used to focused listening. It's like art... look at the texture and line used in this painting.  How is colour used here? Background viewing would be like 'look at this picture and write a story about it.'

<p><i>Management hints for small school music piece with authentic, self-made instruments</i></p>

<p><b>Anne:</b><br>
I am in a small school that often does things in a block. We are looking at presenting a musical piece with the whole school, 32, participating. Many of the instruments will be self-made and some will be authentic, such as digeridoos. Have you any management hints for this novice please?</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b><br>
32 students of different abilities and different instruments are a music teacher's challenge and something we do really well... don't think any other curriculum has to deal with this sort of deal! Firstly, you need to have music that caters for a range of abilities... the readers of music, the non-readers (e.g. playing on designated beat of the bar at specified times such as first 16 bars play on beat 1, then rest for 8 bars, then play for the rest of the piece on beat 1 and 3...). Less experienced performers can play simple beat things like this and especially for the instruments that clang and make loud noises you want them just to play at special climax points, not throughout. So groups of less experienced can rehearse together with a student counting the beat as a conductor.  Practise in segments/chunks, practise with backing tracks (even if it is different music to get the feel of playing in time), or with a drum machine or keyboard drum pattern.  Rehearse groups of instrument types together with lead students being conductors e.g., all wood ones in one group in a space, all drums in another. Bring all together when well rehearsed. When you set up groups rehearsing they need clear guidelines from the start.  How long to practice, how to talk through problems, caring for the instruments, how to listen and watch each other to stay in time and tune. And of course be clear about the main goal &#8211; that they will be performing seriously well in front of an audience in the very near future, so each rehearsal should get better. The last rehearsal is like going into the recording studio &#8211; a make-believe red light goes on and everyone is silent, watching, thinking, ready to play in silence, watching the conductor or leader and concentrating throughout until the light goes off well after the piece has ended. Then they can practise standing together, taking a bow and exiting as a group, all the professional stuff needs practise too. If you are featuring soloists you need to position them where they can be seen. Group layout is important for how sound travels and for conducting purposes. Place people doing the same parts together. Place soloists in the front. </p>
