<p>Excerpts from forum discussion with Ann Brodie (National Coordinator &#8211; The Visual Arts)<br>
19 June 2002</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b> 
<br>
Kia ora and welcome to another visual arts forum. Ann Brodie (National Coordinator &#8211; Visual Arts) is our guest online. This discussion will continue from Ann's last discussion on 'contexts'. This week the focus question will be "How to resource the selected context." The Ministry of Education supports an ongoing publication programme to support the implementation of the new arts curriculum. The visual arts resources that have already been sent to each school include: <i>Exploring the Visual Arts in Years 1&#8211;6,</i> a series of books and posters (Painting, Sculpture, Printmaking, Fibre and Design). Resources being developed this year include: a visual arts resource for teachers with students in years 8&#8211;10 to cater for M&#257;ori students in mainstream education as well as for non-M&#257;ori students. A resource on time-based art is also being planned. Time-based art includes works that are sequenced through time, that change as we view them. </p>

<p><b>Carol Langton:</b> 
<br>
Ann, welcome to the forum. I would like to first of all congratulate you. As the National Coordinator for the visual arts, you have done a great job creating the booklets and poster resources for teachers in schools. These resources are informative, attractive and inspiring.</p> 

<p><b>Hans:</b> 
<br>
I have appreciated the range of resources (especially the booklets) to support visual arts and have a query about a project I did: the Sculpture booklet mentions (p9) that the "focus of attention could be on a sculpture brought from home". If my kids bring up a commercially produced plaster ornament of a woman and child, can we discuss it as "art" or must it be like the Iosepha Iliaia one, a "real" sculpture?</p> 

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b> 
<br>
For those who don't know, Hans is referring to the poster that is part of the Sculpture resource book. The sculpture you have will be able to be discussed in a similar way. Recently the contract facilitators used actual Henry Moore works as a resource to discuss using the questions from this resource. What we discovered was that a teacher needs to be prepared! The questions were not all relevant! Hans, that is straight to a curly one! What is the sculpture like? Anyway, no matter, because the CI strand allows for a discussion about valuing and if it is from your home you have elected to own it, therefore you value it. Hence it is art for you and can be discussed.</p>

<p><b>Jean:</b> 
<br>
I wonder what you mean by resourcing? Are you talking about people resources (like getting someone from the community to demonstrate or help in some way, or finding an expert) or are you talking about material resources such as paint, paper, video, film, photographs or websites? Or is it something else?</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b> 
<br>
A big "yes" is the answer, because people and things such as books, art works and information related to the selected context are all resources that enable a richer learning experience.</p>

      <p><b>Val Duthie:</b> <br>
        I think you will find reference to the Henry Moore exhibition on the Te 
        Papa website below, as Te Papa has developed an education kit to accompany 
        their Henry Moore exhibition. <br>
        <a href="http://www.tepapa.govt.nz/TePapa/English/Learning/OnlineResources/Henry%2BMoore.htm" target="_blank">http://www.tepapa.govt.nz/TePapa/English/Learning/OnlineResources/Henry+Moore.htm</a></p>

<p><b>Hans:</b> 
<br>
Will check up the Henry Moore site. Resources are also expensive and we often don't get enough and have to scrounge around for off-cuts &#8211; that takes time. Can we cut/print out pictures for class from websites like the Louvre or Te Papa and not infringe copyright?</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b> 
<br>
If you can download it, it's ok!</p>

<p><b>Carol Langton:</b> 
<br>
Ask the children's parents to send you their old calendars &#8211; the ones with fine art paintings such as those wonderful impressionist paintings: Monet; van Gogh; Klimt; even the art nouveau calendars and Mucha. And how about Napier architecture, and modern art calendars like Hunterwasser? There are lots of "found" ideas.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b> 
<br>
Good ideas for resourcing, Carol. It is very satisfying to "find " good quality visuals. A coloured laser of a "must have" resource is a good idea too.</p>

<p><b>Carol Langton:</b> 
<br>
Ann, in your last forum discussion about the visual arts and context, you mentioned that when teaching little ones, the context was "self" and "near". I liked that. Can you guide us about self and near when resourcing context for the littlies?</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b> 
<br>
We are talking level 1. Close "me and my" contexts can be enlivened and broadened as you look at the same object from other times and places, for example Nana's dolls, or dolls from Africa or Mexico. I have been running a Contexts course today and a "dolls" context was resourced for that. The Victorian paper doll that had a folded skirt with messages on the folds was an inspiration for construction work (and language)!</p>

<p><b>Carol Langton:</b> 
<br>
I can see the doll context working for all kinds of purposes. I had a Mexican guitar-playing puppet on strings (a marionette) and the girls and boys, both, loved him. The children created many tales of adventure about him and made costumes for him and backdrops for his stories. They used to introduce each other to him. It was a very 'self' and 'near' thing! Another lovely way to use the doll context is to look at Velasquez's little Spanish princess. Children can make gorgeous cake-like dolls from clay, from seeing this work. </p>

<p><b>Jean:</b> 
<br>
I am beginning to use the web to find resources. I have successfully used examples from the Unwrapping the Arts site and I am beginning to use the trial exemplars. I have found these to be really easy to follow and I find that my kids enjoy the way these have been structured. There are lots of other arts websites. Many of them are based overseas. How do you think we can use them in our classes?</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b> 
<br>
Have a look by all means. The sites on Unwrapping the Arts (<a href="http://www.tki.org.elf.internal.cwa.co.nz/e/arts/visarts/visarts_home.php">http://www.tki.org.nz/e/arts/visarts/visarts_home.php</a>) have all been vetted by the writers so we know they are useful. Look on the home page for the visual arts and find the art games addresses there. They will be great for early-finisher rewards. Also, if you want to be clearer about the elements and principles, use the suggested website for the Unwrapped examples. Or use the technology book that came in to schools last year. I am so glad you find the exemplars good value. It has been a joy to work on them!</p> 

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b> 
<br>
The technology book referred to is the Ministry of Education's <i>Design and Graphics in Technology: A Resource for Teachers of Years 1&#8211;8.</i> Content includes: What is Design? Principles of Design; Visual Elements of Design; The History of Design Graphic Techniques; and Modelling.</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b> 
<br>
An institution such as the National Library has a wealth of resources and these can be accessed online &#8211; see below:</p> 
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.natlib.govt.nz/index1.html" target="_blank">http://www.natlib.govt.nz/index1.html</a> 
          <br>
          The National Library of New Zealand website.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li><a href="http://www.natlib.govt.nz/en/services/3curriculum.html" target="_blank">http://www.natlib.govt.nz/en/services/3curriculum.html</a><br>
          The National Library Schools Services.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li><a href="http://www.natlib.govt.nz/en/whatsnew/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.natlib.govt.nz/en/whatsnew/index.html</a><br>
          Included on this site are exhibitions and events. </li>
      </ul>


<p>I understand that coming soon (to be launch on 19 July) will be a new National Library site called <i>Discover,</i> Te Koinga Taonga (Collection of Treasures). I believe that this site is designed for secondary school students at levels 5 &#8211; 8 and that it has around 25,000 items including digital photos, drawings, paintings, posters, manuscripts, video and sound recordings on it. Can you tell us something about that? </p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b> 
<br>
This National Library resource is really exciting. You have access to their wonderful bank of resources (mostly New Zealand, of course) including a poster category, M&#257;ori art, contemporary painting, drawings, and early New Zealand art etcetera. It is almost ready and today we saw the front pages of all the categories. They have tantalising little pictures of the works and then you can discover further examples, details, bibliographies, essays etcetera.</p> 

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b> 
<br>
We all seem to have our own way of finding resources to meet the needs of the context we have chosen. Is there a recommended search pathway that we should adopt? Secondly, I wonder also whether we are better to design our context around the resources we have available or whether it is better to select the context and then go about finding resources?</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b> 
<br>
There are no rules really. If one has a really exciting resource then it is the starting point. Realistically you are often working thematically, so you need to go on a search for particular materials in relation to that. I myself would not find it satisfying to only resource from an electronic source. I think an actual object is pretty important. Good resourcing would probably come from several types of sources.  Val, you might have a pathway other than my way which involves brainstorming and letting my imagination loose. Do you have a suggestion?</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b> 
<br>
I recently visited Hunterwasser's famous toilet in Kawakawa. The context was to design a public toilet. The resources decided upon were the local children, the school work, and locally found or made material resources plus Hunterwasser, the artist. The result was stunning &#8211; a sculptural piece created from locally-made brick and clay tiles made by the children, wonderfully coloured glass bottles, and of course Hunterwasser's amazing creative design ability. Today this is a very well used public toilet that has become a national and international icon. So, use the resources you have around you, I say, but use them creatively. Think laterally and include others.</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b> 
<br>
Yes Hunterwasser is a marvellously inspirational artist ...what fun! Great TV programme on Frank Geary's architecture &#8211; a Hunterwasser type of organic shapes man. Hope someone out there saw it. His work would inspire marvellous building conceptions from children!</p> 

<p><b>Carol Langton:</b>
<br>
For primary teachers who are responsible for teaching seven learning areas, it is common sense to work within themes and work in a cross-curricular programme style. When is it important to teach the visual arts exclusively within its own subject domain?</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b> 
<br>
Pretty sensible to be either and both and to teach the visual arts discipline for itself too. Learning thematically is a way of deepening and broadening understandings. There are lots of benefits. However, sometimes it is hard to be sure that learning in a particular curriculum area that needs attention can be tracked, so it is important to focus clearly on that one area and its Achievement Objectives. A mixture of all of those ways of presenting and experiencing learning is pretty ideal.</p> 

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b> 
<br>
Ann, thanks again for an interesting discussion. Join us again next week when Merryn will be discussing Music resources.</p>
