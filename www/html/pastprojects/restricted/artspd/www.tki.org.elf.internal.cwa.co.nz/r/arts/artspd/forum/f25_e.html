<p>Excerpts from forum discussion with Merryn Dunmill (National Coordinator for the Arts &#8211; Music)<br>
26 June 2002</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b> 
<br>
Kia ora and welcome to the final forum for Term 2. Merryn Dunmill (National Coordinator &#8211; Music) is our guest online. The focus this week is on music resources. Merryn has a wealth of knowledge about music resources, so this is your opportunity to ask the expert. As you are aware, <i>Into Music 1: Classroom Music for Years 1&#8211;3</i> was distributed to your school at the end of 2001. Music handbooks for years 4&#8211;6 and years 7&#8211;10, plus a planning and assessment guide for teachers are currently under development. There is also a resource for secondary school: <i>Sweet: A Taste of New Zealand Music</i> (an audio CD, an accompanying teacher resource book and a CD-ROM) under development. Finally there is a resource on all the main genres of New Zealand music being developed for secondary schools.</p>


<p><b>Win:</b> 
<br>
 I teach in a secondary school in the North Island and am aware that the music teacher in our school uses <i>Into Music 1</i> as a guide to plan and prepare her lessons for secondary students. I wonder how the music handbooks for years 4&#8211;6 and years 7&#8211;10 (mentioned above) will be different from <i>Into Music 1</i>?  When will these new resources be sent to schools? </p>


<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b> 
<br>
 Yes, it is interesting how many secondary schools want <i>Into Music 1</i> which they are adapting by using different musical contexts, but covering many of the same skills and knowledge bases because of the wide range of abilities in any one class. This is, of course, a good thing to do as the curriculum is spiral learning, and revisiting and building on learning is the focus. <i>Into Music 2</i> is in production at present and hopefully will be out end of the year while <i>Into Music 3</i> is being written by a team and we meet once a month with the main writer. It is a lengthy and comprehensive process. This latter guideline will be out next year to all intermediate and secondary schools followed by a <i>Planning and Assessing in Music Guideline</i> (including Music Technology) for all levels, which will begin development next year for 2004 publication and production. The Ministry funds all of these books and CDs and Learning Media produce them with a team of advisers &#8211; lots of quality control. Each of the first three handbooks has chapter headings that are the same but the content, approaches, learning and teaching all grow from each other and shift in emphasis according to child development. They are each useful for the music teacher or interested school and should be seen as a progressive package. Primary or secondary, the kids need the opportunities and the teachers need to see the whole picture. Any non-free copies can be purchased from Learning Media of course.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>
<p><b>Phil: </b> 
<br>
I'm looking at the material on <i>The Rattlin Bog</i> in the resource book <i>Into Music 1</i> (p. 26). There are all sorts of suggestions on this page for helping children to learn this song for example activities such as: </p>
<ul>
<li>folk dance style movements;</li>
<li>identifying instrument accompaniments;</li>
<li>miming;</li>
<li>playing rhythms;</li>
<li>buddying up with an older class to make lagerphones;</li>
<li>talking about folk ballad style of songs; and</li>
<li>listening to other storytelling songs.</li>
</ul>
<p>
These are all great activities to follow up. Finding resources for them takes time though and I'm finding that 'time is of the essence'. Where do you suggest I look to find resources to support these activities that make it an enjoyable and not too time-consuming experience for me?</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b> 
<br>
 My first response is that each idea can lead you to a range of resources but to source some, how about checking out the Teaching and Learning Materials button on <i>Unwrapping the Arts &#8211; Music </i> learning examples, which is very large and up-to-date. A selection of websites is helpful with some that are interactive, midi-downloadable for backing tracks, and can give heaps of background information. Texts are varied and numerous. I will list some main publishers for music here in New Zealand as web addresses, too: </p>

      <ul>
        <li>SOUNZ &#8211; Centre for NZ Music &#8211; <a href="http://www.sounz.org.nz/" target="_blank">www.sounz.org.nz</a><br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Piper's NZ for links to visual arts, music, M&#257;ori arts and culture 
          webs &#8211; <a href="http://www.piperpat.com/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=53" target="_blank">http://www.piperpat.com/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=53</a><br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Te Puna Web Directory &#8211; hosted by the National Library who have 
          a well resourced music centre &#8211; <a href="http://webdirectory.natlib.govt.nz/index.htm" target="_blank">http://webdirectory.natlib.govt.nz/index.htm</a><br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Timeframe &#8211; New Zealand's largest online database of heritage 
          and history images &#8211; <a href="http://www.natlib.govt.nz/" target="_blank">www.natlib.govt.nz</a></li>
      </ul>

<p>This will get you started but remember to check the references in <i>Into Music 1</i> as these are specific to the activities detailed. </p>

<p><b>Phil: </b> 
<br>
Thanks for the websites you have identified. I haven't used these so far, but will have a look. There is a long list of useful references attached to the chapter containing the <i>Rattlin Bog,</i> but we seem to have very few of these resources in school. So I'll have to build up a better resource bank too. It would be great to have access to these resources through TKI.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>
<p><b>Hans:</b> 
<br>
 In my school the resources have been mislaid, lost, or shelved somewhere. It's even hard to get my hands on what came in last year. Changes of staff and no one responsible I guess! Thank goodness for some online resources like Unwrapping The Arts. Can I order a new lot of the print stuff from Learning Media? </p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b> 
<br>
 Very timely.. everyone needs to know Learning Media's address details so that they can re-order those missing resources! So here it is: <br>
Learning Media Limited <br>
P O Box 3293 <br>
Wellington <br>
Phone: (04) 472 5522 <br>
Fax: (04) 472 6444<br>
<a href="http://www.learningmedia.co.nz/" target="_blank">http://www.learningmedia.co.nz</a></p>

<p><b>Hans:</b> 
<br>
 Thanks Merryn. I think of resources as more than the booklets and tapes, like instruments? Are there schemes of sharing or loaning musical instruments between schools? Once we get past the more 'primitive' simple percussion, and the basic recorders, how do we get access to a broader range? Didn't schools once get issued with a piano each? </p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b> 
<br>
The days of department-funded instrument resources are well gone and schools are now funded to resource themselves according to need, as we know. I recommend a piano of course and there may be some kind local who will donate theirs! KBB Music (fax 09 6302231) has a great catalogue as do Piano City, in major centres: they have heaps of good instruments for you to order. There is a general music catalogue that advertises the wares of about 30+ stores nationwide. Look at <a href="http://www.musicworks.co.nz/" target="_blank">www.musicworks.co.nz</a>. Actually you should have a catalogue in your schools because they send copies to all. Some locals make great instruments too, which are good quality. Check the sound and structure of anything if you can and ensure you get something decent to start with, as you save in the end. Instruments are taonga and should be treated with respect as with any other school equipment. I'm not aware of hire schemes between schools as most schools use their gear all the time (hopefully). You may be able to contact local schools and rationalise some more major purchases such as band or electronic gear for special performance purposes.</p>

<p><b>Ces:</b> 
<br>
 We have a CD-ROM called <i>Creative Explorer</i> and it has music with Maree Sheehan on it. It's brilliant! The kids really relate to it and to her. We need more, young, modern role models like her.</p>

<p><b>Carol Langton: </b> 
<br>
It is good to remind people that the CD-ROM <i>Creative Explorer</i> has been posted out to all schools. So, if you have never seen it, search it out. It will be there in your resources collection, we hope. Students with computers at home relate well to CDs as they use them all the time. Actually, they are generally more computer-savvy than we think! </p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill: </b> 
<br>
Just some more good news! The Music Industry Commission has a Rockquest Bands Touring Schools Scheme, too, which is great modelling for our youth. These kids are tutored before touring and travel with a name band as well. The mentoring scheme uses people such as Che Fu, King Kapisi, Garageland and so on. The <i>Sweet</i> resource coming out free to intermediates and secondary schools next term has a CD-ROM and teacher resource manual and the music is all New Zealand musicians role modelling at their best. It is hoped that a similar primary resource will be developed next year thanks to Ministry of Education and Music Industry Commission again. We are busy people as you can see and aim to please!</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b> 
<br>
 "Human resources' are really important too, and there is usually a range of folk &#8211; students in the class, other teachers in the school, parents and community members &#8211; who can provide useful resource input. It is difficult to determine the quality of experience and skill that some of these folks have, though, when you approach them on someone's recommendation. I think it is important to model good practice. Can you give us a steer as how best to do identify 'appropriate' experts in the community? </p>

<p><b>Carol Langton:</b> 
<br>
 I would just like to reinforce that the music case studies on The Arts Online are for all teachers to view. On this page <a href="../materials/cs_e.html">http://www.tki.org.nz/r/arts/artspd/materials/cs_e.php</a>
there is a new case study called <i>Kapa Haka Festival Gala</i> at Okaiawa Primary School, as well as the Music Programme at Belmont Primary School; and there is a new one being prepared that is similar to the Belmont study but comes from Tauranga Intermediate. This includes planning about songwriting and details about how to set up a music suite.</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b> 
<br>
Thanks Carol for this timely reminder of resource ideas on this site. And to Val for bringing in the human aspect at this stage. Yes, he tangata &#8211; it's the people of course who make any of this work. We are stuck without them in time-based arts! Invitations to the community to come to a music event/show/forum even may give students the chance to show their stuff and for community enthusiasts to come out of the woodwork. Creative New Zealand deal with so many wonderful applicants for funding who seek to work with teachers and their students in schools. There are many people in our communities who are wonderful supports to your programme. Going to events in the community, taking students along, inviting local talent in to talk to students about their practice is a first step. Remember to ensure that trained qualified teachers are present of course to support the artists coming into the school: it's not a time for a cup of tea but a time to enhance the learning programme &#8211; not that any of you would miss the opportunity to work with real artists in preference for some time-out. Never! Creative New Zealand actually assesses such artists in schools and monitors outcomes if they fund them, so it is all well run. Secondary schools now have funding for arts coordinators to assist in getting artists into schools and the Music Industry Commission has a very successful music-mentoring scheme running and next year moves out beyond Auckland to Bay of Plenty and Southland!</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Robert:</b> 
<br>
 I find that our local music advisor is really helpful and she has given us some great ideas. <i>Te Puna Web Directory </i>is hosted by the National Library who have a well-resourced music centre <a href="http://tepuna.natlib.govt.nz/web_directory/" target="_blank">http://tepuna.natlib.govt.nz/web_directory/</a>. I haven't used the National Library as a music resource, but others on the staff have and they say it's a fantastic resource. Aren't they setting up a new site especially for teachers?</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b> 
<br>
Lovely music advisers&#8211; aren't they a treat! So special and necessary! <br>
National Library are indeed working at this minute on an online resource site called <i>Discover</i> which has the most wonderful array of New Zealand Music and Visual Arts materials ready to go live, mid-July. They are testing the site right now and it'll be fantastic: original recordings of M&#257;ori waiata and instruments; collaborative projects; pictures; sound bites; recordings and information galore from the 1940s to present day. Largely it is intended for use at senior secondary level but the materials online will appeal and be of use to everyone. I have been lucky enough to see it and I am part of the testing process at the moment. You are guaranteed a great resource with this initiative. It's so well researched and will save you heaps of time! </p>

<p><b>Robert:</b> 
<br>
 As all the teachers in this contract develop resources, it would be good if we could share some of the work that is being done. I realise that there case studies and that other resources are being posted on the Arts Online and in Unwrapping the Arts, but I was thinking more of an informal swap or sharing among teachers. Is this happening? I would be interested in contacting anyone who is keen to do this.</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b> 
<br>
 We did talk about setting up a private site so that teachers could share ideas by posting on it. We didn't have enough 'buy in' to the idea, though.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b> 
<br>
Robert, this is great to read. TKI certainly plans to do more of this in the future I believe and the PD for teachers will continue in the next year or two, so this is a definite goal that I have, too. We have reached a point where we can do this, now, after the initial implementation phase. Knowledge and confidence are building and good practice is being shared openly, which is so heartening. Online is such an ideal way to do this.</p>

<p><b>Win:</b> 
<br>
 We are struggling with NCEA requirements at the moment. Where can we look for resources to help at this level? Is there anything specific other than the range of resources mentioned so far?</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b> 
<br>
 Your adviser in your region is training facilitators to work with you on the next stage and a very comprehensive level 2 manual has been developed. Level 3 exemplars are on their way, too, and more exemplars should be going online for all levels. I am working on finding funding to support the rewriting of the <i>SOUNZwrite </i>guides for levels 1 &#8211; 3 of NCEA. This would make life easier for busy teachers and they are already very good but with the assessment and teaching ideas built in they would be the saving grace. Again, sharing and collaborating are important especially considering most music specialists in secondary schools work in isolation. I hope level 2 PD helps you lots and that the people working on NCEA can continue the developments. My job deals with levels 1 &#8211; 5 of the curriculum but I have been involved right through the NCEA developments and still am in my spare (ha!) time. It's important to keep the links across the levels for junior planning. </p>

<p><b>Carol Langton:</b> 
<br>
 As you see, there is a lot of information about resources on this forum, thanks to Merryn and Val, as well as you wonderful teachers. It would be useful to print a copy of this for your staff to use. Go to the top right hand corner and select 'show a printable version' and print it off to add to your resource folder. </p>

<p><b>Ces: </b> 
<br>
We were talking about using music that has been out of publication for a while. Do we need copyright if it is? Do we need to pay APRA for very old music?</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b> 
<br>
 I think we should have a whole session on this one! Anyway, you are best to get a school licence to cover yourselves. If you are copying old scores that are no longer obtainable there is no real issue except for the legal issues around any photocopying and your school has documentation on this. If you are using copied music for class learning purposes then limited copying is allowed. You only pay if you are performing. In reality, it is impossible for anyone to individually collect royalties so it is an insurance policy really! For class use be safe and keep a few copies only, collect them in and store them. Do not hand out photocopies galore of music even for rehearsal purposes. You are meant to buy multiple copies for performance purposes or hire from SOUNZ if they have what you want. National Library loans out music too. You can email APRA at <a href="mailto:nz@apra.com.au">nz@apra.com.au</a> or hit the website <a href="http://www.apra.com.au/" target="_blank">www.apra.com.au</a> for info.
