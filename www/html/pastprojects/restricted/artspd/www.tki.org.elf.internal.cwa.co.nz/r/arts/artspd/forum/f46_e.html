<h2 class="h2-forum">Developing an Implementation Plan</h2>

<p><a href="index_e.html">Back to Archived Forum Discussion index</a></p>

<p>Excerpts from forum discussion with Catherine Gibbs (Co-director The Arts Online) 7 May 2003.</p>

<p><strong>Sarah Wilson:</strong><br />
The topic for this forum is Developing an Implementation Plan for the Arts, and helping Arts curriculum managers to lead the Arts PD 
for their team. One of the most frequently asked questions from teachers when any new curriculum is introduced is "How do we use this 
document to help us plan a school or class programme?"</p>

<p>During this session we will be discussing various approaches to this question with the intention of providing practical solutions. This 
will include stocktaking, creating the vision, and prioritising. The session will also highlight pathways for providing guidelines to 
Arts curriculum managers working with a school team to build understanding.</p>

<p>Catherine Gibbs is our online guest for the session. Catherine has a wealth of experience in providing advice and guidance to teachers 
and principals about implementing the Arts curriculum. She is co-director of The Arts Online programme 2003 and in previous roles has 
worked as an adviser, lecturer, writer, deputy head, teacher and Ministry of Education Curriculum Facilitator for the arts.</p>

<p><strong>Cathy Gibbs:</strong><br />
I am looking forward to sharing our ideas today as we continue to practise using this new way of learning together. I am interested in 
what you are doing in school to make a start with getting your Arts programmes up and running, and happy to share my ideas with you. I'd 
like to focus on positive ways to help move things along.</p>

<p><strong>Sharron Smith:</strong><br />
I am Arts manager and Visual Arts specialist teacher at Nelson Intermediate School. I am interested in how other schools, particularly 
other intermediate schools, timetable the four disciplines.</p>

<p>Within my school at the moment, Visual Art and Music receive 18 to 20 hours per student per year and 4 to 6 hours of Dance is scheduled 
for Terms 3 and 4 within teams to spread the professional development learning curve. At this stage, Drama will be taken across 
curricula while teachers gain confidence and build up skills and resources. Next year Dance and Drama will be timetabled more 
"formally", probably while seeing the demise of Electives.</p>

<p>I am really intrigued how other schools manage to include all four disciplines within an already crowded timetable.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>
<p><strong>Carol Langton:</strong><br />
We are looking at implementation today. It can be so very different [at a full small primary school] to a large high school or a small 
country school. But the question remains &#8211; as Sharron Smith asked &#8211; how do we fit it all in? Do you have any ideas?</p>

<p><strong>Cathy Gibbs:</strong><br />
Yes, timetabling &#8211; especially at intermediates &#8211; is quite tricky, and every school seems to have a different answer to your question. 
A lot depends on size and spaces available, especially for the equipment-intensive disciplines such as Visual Art and Music. Most 
intermediates I know timetable a core component for each of the disciplines and then invite children to participate in options. 
This is a good way to introduce children to a more specialised pathway in preparation for Year 9. For a start you could read 
strategies tried by different schools to address the issue of meeting the requirements of all four disciplines. Check out the Arts 
Online button under Implementation titled "Issues".</p>

<p><strong>Caroline (West Coast):</strong><br />
Yes, like Sharron we have trouble fitting in the Arts (in a pure sense). We are a small two-teacher school (38 students) and have opted 
to focus on one major and one minor Arts curriculum strand per term. However we have two constraints: the good old end of year concert 
and the "Midland Line Music Festival" where we teach our students approximately ten songs and produce one or two items which are then 
performed in the Greymouth Regent Theatre. This year I have opted for a dance item. So to get around coverage of all areas in the 
document we integrate where possible. I would love some sources for students' ongoing evaluation formats for years 0-8 for cumulative 
file purposes please.</p>

<p><strong>Norma Hubbard:</strong><br />
I'm from Pukenui School in the Far North. I began teaching here at the beginning of the year, as a year two teacher. I have always had 
an interest in Dance and Drama within schools, but I seem to be the only one regularly teaching it within the classroom. I too would 
like to know how other schools are integrating it within a busy day, and also how to persuade others that the Arts are important.</p>


<p><strong>Angela:</strong><br />
I don't know if this is relevant to today's discussion, but I would love to explore the relationship between primary and secondary 
delivery of the curriculum. Ideally, in the long term, I believe that it would be great if students had a seamless transition through 
the levels (as suggested in the document), despite changing schools (i.e. junior &#8211; intermediate &#8211; senior). It feels like an incredibly 
huge project &#8211; does anyone have any ideas about how we could start? I believe that some sort of co-ordination could help us all out.</p>

<p><strong>Cathy Gibbs:</strong><br />
[To Caroline] Yes it's a balancing act alright. I agree that the way to go is a major minor focus in your situation. How about integrate 
with the minor selected discipline and focus intensively on teaching the new skills with the major one each term. Secondly, planning for 
the concert need not be considered as extra but an integral part of your planning cycle. Know your destination, but the process of 
teaching something new along the way is the important bit. Can you plan and reflect on what improvements the children have made to 
their knowledge and understanding in the particular thing you chose to do as learning outcomes? The concert items will "fall out" of 
your thriving weekly programme!</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>
<p><strong>Carol Langton:</strong><br />
In response to Caroline's request for assessment guidelines, please go to <a href="../implementation/assess_e.html">http://www.tki.org.nz/r/arts/artspd/implementation/assess_e.php</a> and 
there you will find a range of specific guidelines for all four disciplines.</p>

<p><strong>Whangara:</strong><br />
With regard to the Arts I was copying units from the documents or using the examples in there and adapting them to what I want. I had 
ERO earlier this year and they said the units I adapted were on the mark &#8211; others that were my old units were not. Apart from Art and 
Drama, I don't like taking Music so I swap classes with another teacher and take her class for Maori and she teaches Music. I need to 
upskill in all Arts areas.</p>

<p><strong>Carol Langton:</strong><br />
This URL is a good place to go to look at a range of teacher issues that have arisen in the past. One of them deals with covering all 
four Arts disciplines, one of them is about teaching special needs children through the Arts, one of them is about M&#257;ori pedagogy, etc. 
They are a good collection of topics. Check them out on <a href="../implementation/issues_e.html">http://www.tki.org.nz/r/arts/artspd/implementation/issues_e.php</a></p>

<p><strong>Cathy Gibbs:</strong><br />
The curriculum document itself is a blueprint for the seamless curriculum. It has been linked from Te Whaariki through to NCEA levels 
one and two and beyond. The Ministry is also aware that the transition points at 5 yrs, 13yrs and 17yrs need very careful scrutiny and 
attention right now. It has been a particular focus during the Curriculum Stocktake process.</p>

<p><strong>Caroline:</strong><br />
I've gleaned some great tips. You're so right. Including the skills focus is what I did with year 4 to 8 in a major dance unit and now 
we are confident to incorporate this as the concert item, but it will only be the minor planning aspect for next term. Off the topic 
sorry but does anyone know where I can source the musical "Kidsummer Night's Dream"?</p>

<p><strong>Cathy Gibbs:</strong><br />
[To Norma] As a brilliant place to start for plenty of material to inspire others about the importance of the Arts in developing the 
whole person try visiting this site &#8211; and careful with the spelling of "center" it is correct here: <a href="http://artsedge.kennedy-center.org/champions/exec_summ.html" target="_blank">http://artsedge.kennedy-center.org/champions/exec_summ.html</a>
I am hoping that in NZ we can do a similar study &#8211; but of course ten years is a long time in this fast-paced environment. We don't get 
very clear and strong indicators if we keep on pulling up the roots of the young tree to see how well it is growing!</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>
<p><strong>Carol Langton:</strong><br />
I shall just take this opportunity to give you the School Self Review URL: <a href="../materials/reviewforms_e.html">http://www.tki.org.nz/r/arts/artspd/materials/reviewforms_e.php</a> The 
review enables us to help you refine a useful, purpose-built professional development programme. One that is suited to your own needs.</p>

<p><strong>Cathy Gibbs:</strong><br />
[To Sharron] It sounds as if your school is approaching the changes necessary to accommodate dance and drama into the busy timetable 
really well. Unless staff feel confident in taking a series of lessons in dance and drama there is little point in pushing it too hard. 
Have a good look around the Arts Online site and you will find heaps of material you can print off and use with other staff members 
interested in getting some help to teach the disciplines better. For example, under the button Implementation go to Curriculum Plans 
and then choose "practical examples of planning". Here you will find ideas that have been trialled successfully by real teachers out 
there giving it a go.</p>

<p><strong>Norma Hubbard:</strong><br />
I have just had another look at our Arts plan and I realise that it hasn't been updated for quite some time so I have a good place to 
start. On a positive note I include both dance and drama regularly within my language programme and see some really good results, with 
understanding and class dynamics. What suggestions do you have to begin PD within the school? All are very receptive to new ideas, 
but I'm not sure where or how to start.</p>

<p><strong>Dianne Dunn:</strong><br />
We have a major focus each term. Term one was music major, term two is dance major, term three is drama major, and term four will be 
the concert. Visual Arts is always ongoing. Today we danced the day away preparing for a dance festival. Children are choreographing 
a creative dance based on a journal story: birds, trees, rainbows &#821; we're having a great time.</p>

<p><strong>Carol Langton:</strong><br />
[To Lee-Ann] How does a small school like yours find the expertise to teach Music, Drama, Dance and the Visual Arts?</p>

<p><strong>Tom Evans:</strong><br />
We allocate 20 hours per year Visual Arts. But many class teachers take art in their own rooms and I am able to assist them with 
ideas, techniques etc. Dance was our theme last year. This year it is Stage Challenge which involves up to 150 people with all the Arts 
activities that go with that. Music and Drama are poor losers. This is an area we need to look at and stimulate.</p>

<p><strong>Carol Langton:</strong><br />
We have seen an overview design called "The lava lamp". It would suit a year's programme. In the lava lamp there are large floating 
shapes. The plan looks a bit like that ... there could be a blob in term one week 6 for a drama production, term two week 5 for an art 
exhibition, term three week 10 a dance performance, and term four week whatever for music ... Can you visualise this?</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>
<p><strong>Cathy Gibbs:</strong><br />
[To Norma] Gosh there are so many ways to make a start. How about starting with a question to get everyone thinking about the impact of 
the Arts in their own lives, for example, "Tell us about your most recent Arts-related experience and how did you respond?" Or from 
where you are sitting right now can you see something that would stimulate a discussion about why we might teach the Arts at school? 
[You could] invite each teacher to describe their own journey in learning in one of the Arts disciplines &#821; going right back to childhood 
and the influences that have played a part in bringing them to where they are today. This could also be communicated using some of the 
disciplines, for example drawing a line and hanging pics at significant moments, acting a role, or recalling special songs or pieces of 
music that they will always remember because of the context they were in at the time. The idea is that you want them to engage in a 
meaningful exercise focussing on the deep and meaningful way the Arts pervade everyone's lives. You could also go the formal pathway 
and begin with the official journey by "opening up the book" &#821; all these steps are here for you under the Arts Online RH button called 
"Teacher PD materials".Have a look at all the help provided here ... all done for you to adapt!</p>

<p><strong>Caroline:</strong><br />
Dianne your school/class sounds very similar to mine and I would love to throw caution to the wind and have a Dance Day ... thanks for 
the motivation.</p>

<p><strong>Annie, Waiheke:</strong><br />
I'm at Waiheke High, we have a year 7 to year 13 school of just 500. We live in paradise on an island 35 mins from Auckland. I am HOD 
arts. We have a strong Arts community and our students are individualistic. Great to be part of the Arts Revolution &#8211; Lets Dance 
Soon!</p>

<p><strong>Norma Hubbard:</strong><br />
We resource people in our wider community for specific help in some areas, for example line dancing and choir singing. Otherwise we 
maximise our staff strengths. I am interested in this seamless education ideal. I have worked for eight years in Playcentre gaining 
preschool points along the way. I find the transition to the year 5 curriculum to be huge leap and wonder what is in action to bridge 
this gap. Te Whaariki seems to provide for far more child-directed art. Overnight children seem to be asked to adjust to a 
product-directed art.</p>

<p><strong>Carol Langton:</strong><br />
[To Tom] There is a lot to read and absorb isn't there. I agree that sometimes Music and Drama are the disciplines that get left out. 
We have to work fairly diligently to ensure that they get their chance in the sun and that they get taught properly &#8211; the elements and 
techniques of drama, and of music. I believe all teachers benefit from as much PD in these areas as possible.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>
<p><strong>Angela:</strong><br />
[to Annie] Not that it isn't really interesting to see the dilemmas facing the inter-disciplinary teachers, but it is great to have 
someone out there who is at a high school. Annie, sounds like your school is similar to mine &#8211; size, semi-rural ... but probably much 
better supported by the local community in your focus on developing the Arts. Do you have all your Arts subjects together in one 
department, or do you run traditional departments as well as curriculum areas?</p>


<p><strong>Cathy Gibbs:</strong><br />
[To Annie] You have a great spot to encourage students to grow in the Arts. What particular challenges do you face?</p>

<p><strong>Diane Dunn:</strong><br />
When the mood strikes we push back the desks and dance &#8211; better than trying to force it out of them when they are not in the mood. 
Year 8 M&#257;ori boys being trees is a rewarding experience...</p>

<p><strong>Norma Hubbard:</strong><br />
Sometimes finding the right place to begin is all that's needed. I know it is for me. I agree with you Tom about the need for PD and I'm 
wondering if that's what's needed to inspire others to think about Arts within their classroom.</p>

<p><strong>Cathy Gibbs:</strong><br />
[To Lee-Ann] I assume you mean the five year olds not year 5. Yes there are some careful discussions going on about helping children 
make the transition from Te Whaariki, which focuses on the dispositions, and into an outcomes-based curriculum at year 0. The National 
Exemplars will include this assistance for teachers with juniors. I think that the child-centred approach is not lost, there are 
plenty of primary teachers who would be adamant that they are approaching their teaching by focussing on the needs of their learners. 
The new Arts curriculum is not a prescriptive document and leaves plenty of room for teachers to develop a "child centred" programme 
in the four Arts disciplines.</p>

<p><strong>Annie, Waiheke:</strong><br />
[To Angela] I ... would like to compare notes. We have four staff, covering design, photography, painting, at senior level in Visual 
Arts. The Music and Drama departments are separate but I am their HOD for official stuff. Each has its own budget. We have an 
interdisciplinary HIP HOP class for ten year 10 boys who are "very active".</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong><br />
We were involved in the trial of some exemplars for Visual Arts. The facilitators who came to see us seemed preoccupied with product 
and relayed that message strongly to our junior class teacher. This was a concern for Lee-Ann and I who are strong advocates of 
child-centred learning.</p>

<p><strong>Samantha Thompson:</strong><br />
I am a teacher at Hatea-a-rangi School in Tokomaru Bay. We are a three teacher school with 54 students. We have a strong Kapa Haka and 
Visual Art base at our school but are yet to develop the other areas of the Arts curriculum. I am looking forward to learning more about 
how this is done. I am not quite sure where to begin.</p>

<p><strong>Shirley:</strong><br />
I found the Matamau School long term plan very helpful as an overview. I think that the staff members that I have shown it to are no 
longer feeling that implementation is going to be as bad as they first thought. I am starting to introduce the four disciplines at 
staff meetings. Alongside all the great resources that we have from the government I am going to put this plan so the staff can see 
how it might fit.</p>

<p><strong>Sharon Smith:</strong><br />
Hawera Intermediate allocates 20 hours per year to each student for Visual Arts. We run a dance festival, so many hours are taken up 
in practice and presentation &#8211; none this year due to Stage Challenge. This has taken its place and involves maybe up to 150 students 
and teachers making props, costumes, performing etc. Drama and Music do not seem to have an allocation, must depend upon the 
interest/ability of the teacher. I would like to know how to encourage the practice of these other arts. We are trying to concentrate 
on a particular art form - dance last year, with adviser and local expertise. This year the stage challenge, next year perhaps drama. 
The need is for the Arts to become part of the culture.</p>

<p><strong>Barbara Tait:</strong><br />
At our school we have a 40 minute slot on a Monday morning where we offer instrumental music, tuned and percussion, and dance and drama 
lessons to the children. All children get to play at least three tuned percussion instruments (recorder, guitar and xylophone/ukulele). 
The dance and drama classes are taken in five-week blocks and the guitar etc. ten-week or term. This action culminates in our end of 
year production. We have very good community and parent support to help us with this each week &#8211; it's a big commitment to those 
"Helpers" who come in.</p>


<p><strong>Chris:</strong><br />
I need some help if anyone has any ideas. We are a three-teacher school and have now tried two different ways of implementing the Arts 
programme. Last year we tried to have a major focus on two disciplines a term (this didn't work as nothing seemed to get carried to a 
satisfactory conclusion and we felt the time span wasn't long enough). This year we are trialling one discipline per term (I know it's 
only the beginning of term 2) but it seems like a huge break before you focus on things again. Any bright ideas for organising this?</p>
