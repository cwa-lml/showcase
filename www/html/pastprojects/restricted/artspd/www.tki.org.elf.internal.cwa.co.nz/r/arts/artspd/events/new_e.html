<p>Arthur Efland is professor emeritus at the Ohio State University. In this book, he discusses ways in which new developments in cognitive science can be applied to the cognitive nature of learning in the visual arts, and to arts education in general. As an educator, he focuses his argument on how the arts can be used to develop cognitive ability in children.</p>

<img src="../img/design.gif" width="50" height="70" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="0" align="right" alt="Design">

<p><i>Design and Graphics in Technology</i> is a resource for teachers 
        of years 1 to 8 and is the eighth book in a series designed to support 
        the implementation of <i>Technology in the New Zealand Curriculum</i>. 
        The book aims to provide teachers with a better understanding of the theoretical 
        basis of design as well as the role of design in the technological processes. 
        The book has six main sections covering the principles of design, visual 
        elements of design, the history of design, graphic techniques, modelling, 
        and design in the classroom. The principles of design are outlined. These 
        include movement, harmony, proportion, pattern, and rhythm as well as 
        style and contrast. Colour, point, line, shape, tone, form, and texture 
        are discussed in a section on the visual elements of design. Sketching, 
        rendering and formal drawing systems are some of the techniques described. 
        Overall the book is well placed to support the new arts curriculum statement. 
      </p>

      <p> Student activities are suggested throughout the book. These are generally 
        aimed at the older primary age group. Several case studies are included. 
        These are Developing an Environment: Years 1 &#8211; 3, Developing a System: 
        Years 4 &#8211; 6, and Developing a Product: Years 7 &#8211; 8. Objectives 
        for Year 9 &#8211; 13 students in graphics programmes provide an indication 
        of where the foundation learning in years 1 to 8 in design and graphics 
        leads. Published by <a href="http://www.learningmedia.co.nz/">Learning

<img src="../img/1dancing.gif" width="50" height="70" hspace="3" vspace="3" align="right" border="0" alt="Dancing the Long White Cloud">

<p>This set of two videos and teacher's booklet is the first Ministry resource to support dance in the new arts curriculum. It has been written for teachers of students in years 1&#8211;6, and for teachers of dance students in years 7&#8211;10.</p>

<p>It aims to help teachers implement the dance curriculum by video demonstration supported by detailed explanation in the accompanying booklet. With clear explanations of the strands, achievement objectives, and learning outcomes of dance, it is intended that these new materials will help teachers understand important aspects of dance education. The booklet addresses concerns of teachers who are teaching dance for the first time and provides practical ideas for planning and assessment.</p>

<p>The two videos help teachers recognise good practice in classroom dance by using accessible teacher models. They include extensive footage in a wide range of school settings, with varying levels of complexity, and in different situations with students at different levels.</p>

<p><i>Dancing the Long White Cloud</i> videos and booklet are intended to be used together as part of staff professional development and to help plan for specific groups of students. The booklet includes a helpful interactive section for teachers as learners.</p>
