<h2 class="h2-forum">Chorus of movement, chorus of voices</h2>

<p><a href="index_e.html">Back to Archived Forum Discussion index</a></p>

<p>Excerpts from forum discussion with Peter O'Connor (National Coordinator &#8211; Drama)<br>
1 May 2002</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b> 
<br>
Tena koutou. Welcome to another drama forum with Peter O'Connor (National Coordinator &#8211; Drama) as guest online. The focus of this forum will be Drama Conventions.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>Chorus of Movement (a group moving together with a sense of purpose. The movement may be repetitive or stylised).<br><br>
</li> 

<li>Chorus of Voices (a group using their voices together to make patterns of sound; used to increase the impact of a dramatic moment).</li> 
</ol>
 

<p>Suggested background reading to inform the discussion: Booklet: <i>Drama in the Classroom: A Resource for Teachers of Year 1&#8211;10</i> (pp8&#8211;9). Video: <i>Drama in the Classroom: A Resource for Teachers of Year 1&#8211;10.</i> (Video time code 43.58 &#8211; chorus of movement); (Video time code 41.11 &#8211; chorus of voices).</p> 

<p><b>Carol Langton:</b> 
<br>
I am looking forward to learning about a chorus of movement! My question is a simple one. In music we have a chorus: how is the word "chorus" used differently in drama?</p> 

<p><b>Phil:</b> 
<br>
I recognise the impact of this convention as I have seen it used successfully in a range of contexts. I have not used this convention with my class yet and would find it useful to have some guidance on how best to introduce it to the class?</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Jean:</b> 
<br>
What makes a good chorus of movement? Do the group all have to move together, at exactly the same time? Should they be acting as one?</p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b> 
<br>
I imagine that each chorus of movement would have different purposes. For example, a piece that shows everybody thinking the same thing, might have a chorus of movement where it is really important that everyone does everything the same, with a tight, choreographed, movement pattern. However, the chorus might show conflicting viewpoints, which is how the Greeks originally used the form, so the needs are different. Good chorus movement is that which achieves the goals the students have identified for the use of the convention. Or you as the teacher can identify that too.</p>

<p><b>Jean:</b> 
<br>
If we were to set up conflicting viewpoints, I guess that we could need sufficient numbers to call each group a chorus. Is there a recognised number of people that make up a chorus? In the video clip mentioned as background preparation for this discussion, it showed a year 10 class using a chorus of movement to portray Antigone coming to claim her brother's body. If you can recall this clip, which part of this performance is working really well? If you were the teacher of this class what would be saying to the student's about their performance?</p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b> 
<br>
Yes chorus implies more than one, and I have seen chorus work done with small groups. In the <i>Antigone</i> drama I would be asking questions related to the strands, I guess. With SLOS around the PK strand I might consider questions around how well the group had achieved its goal of reinforcing or magnifying the grief felt by the main protagonists. In DI, I would be interested in finding out &#8211; possibly from their diaries &#8211; how they had worked out and trialled different ways to achieve their work: and in CI, I might be interested in how the audience (possibly their peers are reading what they have done). In UC, I might be interested in knowing how much they know about the history and tradition of chorus and how their version fits or subverts that.</p>

<p><b>Christine:</b> 
<br>
I will be starting a unit of drama shortly so look forward to some ideas. What sort of themes would one use in a chorus of movement? In my junior class today, we talked about the word "stealthily" and acted it out. Is this a suitable means to achieving drama objectives? I had not intended it to be drama, but as they were acting it out, I realised that it was a form of drama. Is this what you mean by a chorus of movement?</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b> 
<br>
Christine, can you tell us a bit about what you want to include in this unit? What theme(s) are you using? How long will the unit last? Do you intend to include the conventions we are looking at today, that is, the chorus of movement and the chorus of voices?</p> 

<p><b>Christine:</b> 
<br>
At this time, I am not sure. I have set aside two afternoons a week for almost half an hour until the end of term. I am a little uncertain where to start, but I thought that the idea of the <i>Three Billy Goats Gruff</i> unit would be ideal. I also have a few puppets in my classroom. I own a rooster one, which no child is allowed to touch. I have used it on occasions, but am not very good at being in role: lack of self-confidence and imagination. I have also been reading the drama conventions and am slowly developing ideas from this. But am still a little unsure of what is mean by a chorus of movement.</p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b> 
<br>
Chorus is an established way of working in drama for a very long time. It goes back to the Greeks and yet of course there are many ways to play and use it. The key thing is not the teaching of the convention but the learning about drama your students get as they learn to manipulate another dramatic form or convention. In a sense, that answers the question about how to measure the quality of a chorus movement piece. It is about how well they manipulate the elements of drama. Have they built tension and/or focus by the use of this convention? How have they used space and time to convey meaning? Teachers can, of course, use chorus movement for a range of purposes in classroom drama. It might be for process drama or it might be for performance.</p>

<p><b>Carol Langton:</b>
<br>
How can we teach five year olds conventions like this? It's like "herding cats" isn't it with that age group, except that I know freeze frames work well &#8211; for three seconds! And could you give us an example of how you would use a vocal chorus during drama, say for level 4.</p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b> 
<br>
I must admit that the best and most exciting drama I have ever seen (including the West End in London, Broadway etcetera) has been drama work with four and five year olds. They have a closer connection to drama than any adult actor could ever dream of having. I'm loathe to teach conventions at this level. The curriculum talks about conventions in the AOs only at level 3. At level 1 and 2, I think you are working in quite naturalistic and linear ways with kids. Teacher-in-role, of course, is the convention par excellence in working at this age level. Having said that, I remember a group of kids at only three years old, moving as detectives across the ground in a chorus movement, searching for pieces of a stolen rainbow. What five year olds bring to drama is an amazing ability to suspend disbelief and engage in a fictional world that teachers can pick up on in drama. That is unbelievably exciting.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b> 
<br>
My introduction to this convention of Balinese fire dance was in Bali where I watched the village men in a fire dance performance. Around 50 men (in unison) sat, knelt, stood, jumped, swayed and crept around in a circle. They slapped their thighs, used sticks to create sounds and patterns and finally they sighed, hissed and shouted. This all came to a climax in a spectacular demonstration of sound and movement when they leapt into the air, and the cacophony of sound created was almost unbearable to listen to. I think I am right in saying that this performance was an excellent use of these conventions.</p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b> 
<br>
Sounds amazing, Val. I've just gone back and rechecked questions. Hi Phil and Christine. I think there is limited value in teaching the conventions separately but there is much better strength in teaching it as part of the work you are doing and finding things that more naturally lend themselves either to movement or voice chorus. For example, you're doing some work around the theme of people migrating to New Zealand in the 1800s. You might use a whole range of conventions to explore the why and how they have left. To reveal the movement across the sea and all the things that might happen on the ship &#8211; including death, storms and marriages and babies &#8211; the task of the students might be to present this via either kind of chorus convention. If they do this I would be keen to know what the kids learnt both about the trip across and also what they learnt about drama. By doing this you can cover two or three curriculum areas in one hit &#8211; frees up that crowded curriculum. And that is good, or at least appropriate, level 4 chorus work I guess Carol (trying to answer your question too).</p>

<p><b>Jean:</b> 
<br>
Other than the MoE video that I have looked at, could you suggest other resources that I could have a look at to help me use this convention in class? I can see tremendous possibilities for this way of working. I just need a little more confidence, I guess.</p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b> 
<br>
Totally agree with Carole about keeping it simple. The key though about drama, is that we do things in role: that's one of our elements. So if the students are burglars all retuning from their night out stealing and are carrying their sacks carefully, they will create a chorus of movement almost naturally. Acting the word "stealthily" isn't really drama to me. I think the thing we need to recognise is that different conventions serve different purposes. Hot seating explicates characters, 
Voices in the head allow us to understand the motives of different roles. Teacher-in-role establishes a group drama. Chorus is a poetic or symbolic convention and to achieve this deliberately takes some skill and understanding of how to work in, and with, symbolic forms. Jonothan Neeland's book <i>Structuring Drama</i> is the best book available on drama conventions and in it he talks at some length about the different functions for each convention. This will help you to work out how and when to use or teach a particular convention with a group. It seems chorus is not what you start with when beginning a session: they need to explore characters, and understand and reflect on the drama before moving straight to the poetic.</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b> 
<br>
Thanks Peter for your guidance in helping us to understand more fully what is meant by chorus of movement. It would be really good to hear from those who are working with these conventions in class. So if you introduce chorus of movement or chorus of voices, please share your experiences with us on the next drama forum. Until then, take care, explore and experiment and have fun.</p>
