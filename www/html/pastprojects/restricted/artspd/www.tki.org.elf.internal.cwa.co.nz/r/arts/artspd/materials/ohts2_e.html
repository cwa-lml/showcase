			<li>
				<i>The Arts in the New Zealand Curriculum</i> is one of the essential learning areas identified in the New Zealand Curriculum Framework
			<li>
				The curriculum includes all four disciplines - Dance, Drama, Music and Visual Arts. 
			<li>
				Learning in all four disciplines is essential, in order for schools to provide curriculum that has depth and breadth, consistent with the requirements of NAG 1 
			<li>
				It is expected that students will study all 4 disciplines in years 1-8 and study in at least two disciplines in years 9-10
		</ul>
	<p>
		The document clearly signals that each discipline has <i>"its own knowledge and means of inquiry."</i>  <b>p.7</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		With the above points in full view discuss the implications for your school-wide and classroom programmes.

	<h4>
		The Arts
	</h4>
			
	<p>
		<i>"The Arts are powerful forms of personal and social expression.  They link imagination, thinking and feeling.  They provide essential learning for living and develop a wide range of both general and specific skills, which are significant in many aspects of life, including employment.  They are important for recreation and leisure.</i>
	</p>
	<p align="right">		
		(The New Zealand Curriculum Framework Ministry of Education, 1993)
	</p>	
	<p>
		<i>"What strikes me is the fact that in our society, art has become something which is related only to objects and not to individuals or to life.  That art is something which is specialised or which is done by experts who are artists.  But couldn't' everyone's life become a work of art? From the idea that the self is not given to us, I think that there is only one practical consequence. We have to create ourselves as a work of art."</i>
	</p>
	<p align="right">		(Rabinow, Paul (ed.) (1984).<br>
		(<i>The Foucault Reader</i>.  London: Penguin.pp.350-351)
	</p>
	<p>
		<i>"New Zealand is a small nation in an increasingly globalised world. What is unique about us are our arts, our culture, and our heritage. In the twenty-first century, they will define us as the confident, proud, and creative peoples we are."</i>
	</p>
	<p align="right">	
		(Helen Clark, May 2000)
	</p>
	<p>
		In the statements above, identify commonalities and different perspectives (key phrases/words) and discuss.
	</p>

<br>	
<li>
	<h4>
		The Arts p.9 <a href="ohts1_e.html#oht9">(OHT 9)</a>
	</h4>
	
	<i>
		"The arts develop the artistic and aesthetic dimensions of human experience. They contribute to our intellectual ability and to our social, cultural, and spiritual understandings. They are an essential element of daily living and of lifelong learning." p.9
	</i>
	
	<p>
		The three sentences encapsulate a philosophy and rationale.  Compare this with your current views
	</p>

<br>
<li>
	<h4>
		On reading p.9 note the following:
	</h4>
	
	<p>
		Paragraph one gives strong arguments for studying the arts and maintains that they are an essential contribution to human endeavours.
	</p>
	<p>
		Paragraph two gives clear indications and examples of the diversity and range of art and art forms encompassed.
	</p>

<br>	
<li>
	<h4>
		Education in the Arts p.10
	</h4>	
	From your current understandings of arts education describe what students will:
		<ol type="a">
			<li>
				generate
			<li>
				understand
		</ol>
	<p>
		Compare this to what is stated in the first paragraph <b>p.10</b> noting the key statement that  <i>"All New Zealanders have a right to an education in the arts as part of their schooling."</i>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		How will this impact on your programme planning and implementation?
	</p>

<br>
<li>
	<h4>
		Literacies in the Arts <a href="ohts1_e.html#oht3">(OHT 3)</a> p.10
	</h4>	
	
	<p>
		Developing literacies in the arts is not seen as only text based and not the sole province of Maths and English. It is a core idea within this curriculum.  Literacies in this document means " <i>the ability to communicate and interpret meaning in the arts disciplines.</i>" 
	</p>

	<p>
		In addition:
	</p>

	<p>
		"Literacies in the arts require an understanding of particular cultural and practical conventions within each arts discipline."  <b>p.11</b><br>
		Again this signals that skills, knowledge and understanding in one discipline do not necessarily imply the same in other disciplines. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Paragraph 5 - makes the point that <b>everyone</b> "the performers, the makers and the viewers and listeners"p.11 needs an education in the arts. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Paragraph 6 - A key message is that an arts education is a life long, enriching process for all New Zealanders, beginning with young children.
	</p>

<br>
<li>
	<h4>
		Aims p.12
	</h4>
		
	<p>
		The same aims are shared by all four disciplines <a href="ohts1_e.html#oht4"><b>(OHT 4-5)</b></a>
	</p>
	
	<h4>
		Structure p.13 <a href="ohts1_e.html#oht8">(OHT 8)</a>
	</h4>		
	
	<p>
		On this page, clearly supported by the diagram, it is stated that there are four separate disciplines with clear indications that each have a distinctive knowledge base
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<b>Match each strand with the associated Achievement statement below:<br>
	STRAND</b>
	</p>
	
		<ol start="1">
			<li>
				Developing Practical Knowledge in the Arts (PK)
			<li>
				Developing Ideas in the Arts (DI)
			<li>
				Communicating and Interpreting in the Arts (CI)
			<li>
				Understanding the Arts in Context (UC)
		</ol>
		<br>
		<ol type="a">
			<li>
				communicate and interpret meaning in the arts, presenting and responding to a wide range of art works;
			<li>
				understand the arts in context, investigating art works and the arts in relation to their social and cultural settings;
			<li>	
				develop practical knowledge in the arts, exploring and using the elements, conventions, processes, techniques and technologies of each arts discipline;
			<li>
				develop ideas in the arts, individually and collectively, drawing on a variety of sources of motivation to make art works.
		</ol>
	
	<p>
		Discuss what each of these strands might entail in practical terms, thinking of examples from a range of disciplines.
	</p>
	
<br>
<li>
	<p>
		Although each discipline has four identified strands it is important to note that these strands are all interrelated and present at any one time in varying degrees. Note diagram <b>p.14</b> illustrating the interlinking/interwoven nature of the strands within each discipline.<a href="ohts1_e.html#oht6"><b>(OHT 6)</b></a> 	
	</p>	
	<p>
		Discuss the implications of this for your programme.
	</p>

<br>
<li>
	<h4>
	Achievements Objectives <a href="ohts1_e.html#oht7">(OHT 7)</a> p.15
	</h4>
	
	<p>
	There are eight levels as in all other curriculum areas <a href="ohts1_e.html#oht9"><b>(OHT 9)</b></a>.  The mussel shell reflects a spiralling view of learning, encapsulated in the students revisiting the same material in subsequent levels but having more depth and breadth of knowledge, skills and understanding to work with it. Note that Level 1-4 Achievement Objectives in all disciplines are shown in a useful chart at the back <b>pp 108,109</b>. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Note in this chart, the developmental nature of the AOs and the changing descriptors as the key indicators for teaching progression.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Using a photocopy of the chart in the back of the document, go through Dance PK strand levels 1 to 4 highlighting the changing descriptions. Repeat this task for Drama DI strand, Music CI strand and Visual Arts UC strand.
		Discuss these progressions.

		Action and Reflection <a href="ohts1_e.html#oht11">(OHT 11-12)</a>
	</h4>	

	On <b>p.88</b> is a wave in motion clearly emphasising that the action and reflection cycle is a dynamic process uniting theory with practice. Action and Reflection are integral to "making, presenting and evaluating individual art works." P89. 	
	
	<p>
		When might students demonstrate this fundamental learning strategy?	
	</p>

<br>	
<li>
	<h4>
		Planning School Programmes
	</h4>
	
	The key point on <b>p.90</b> emphasises  <i><b>"in years 1-8 students must study, and have opportunities to meet achievement objectives in all four disciplines"</b>. Note that although study of all four disciplines is a must, "schools have flexibility in determining the weighting they will give to individual disciplines at each level of schooling, according to the needs of their students."</i> p.90

<li>
	<h4>
		Assesssment
	</h4>
	
	<p>
		<b>p.92</b> contains very useful information on assessment - forms, analysis and functions.
	</p>

	<p>
		Select two learning examples from the document pp.22-82<br>
		Generate two specific learning outcomes for each example<br>
		Use the information on p.92 and discuss how you might assess these SLO's 
	</p>	

<br>
<li>
	<h4>
		Essential skills pp 99-101
	</h4>
	
	These are examples of how the arts contribute to the essential skills. Identify a topic or unit you teach in one of the disciplines. Make a list of the essential skills that are included in this topic or unit.
	
	<p>
	<a href="ohts1_e.html#oht13"><b>(OHT 13-14)</b></a><br>
	The last sections are important to understand especially in relation to implementing programmes. They provide very useful sets of information from which to draw and make links to.
