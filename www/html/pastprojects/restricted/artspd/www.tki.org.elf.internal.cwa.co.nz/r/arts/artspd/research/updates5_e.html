 <p><b>Ralph Buck, Dance Lecturer, University of Otago</b></p>



<p>
This paper was first presented as part of the Education and Training Symposium at World Dance Alliance 2001: Asia Pacific Dance Bridge, Singapore </p>


<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
This presentation will introduce my PhD research about primary school teachers' meanings of dance in their classrooms. I will outline the New Zealand context and my personal context in coming to this study. I will briefly outline my research methodology and then discuss some initial observations and the implications these may have for dance education in New Zealand.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>
<h3>The New Zealand context</h3>

<p>
Dancing is not new in New Zealand schools. It has a history of marginalised inclusion in either the physical education programme or, to a lesser extent, the junior music programme, both being predominantly taught by non-specialist classroom teachers. Currently in New Zealand there is a building ground swell of interest and concern as dance becomes redefined within the new national arts curriculum and moves away from the aegis of physical education. In 2003, dance will have a mandate to be taught in its own right within all schools via <i>The Arts in the New Zealand Curriculum</i> (2000). </p>


<p>
The new curriculum is modelled upon a discipline-based arts education framework and includes dance, drama, music, and visual arts. This document represents a landmark in New Zealand dance education history, being the first of its kind to enter schools with the mandate that &quot;in years1-8, students must study, and have opportunities to meet achievement objectives in all four disciplines&quot; (Ministry of Education, 2000, p. 90).</p>
 

<p>
However, just how much work will be included in each discipline (dance, drama, music, visual arts) is at the discretion of each school, &quot;schools can decide the balance&quot; (<i>Otago Daily Times</i>, 2000). How much is taught is up to the teacher. The curriculum has outlined a vision for the scope of implementing dance education and as such could be said to be idealistic. How much is taught, how and when it is taught is the teacher's reality. I believe these realities are informed by the teacher's personal vision of education and the place of dance in that vision.</p>


<p>
For teachers with an interest in dance education, the curriculum vision is achievable, but others may relate to the teacher who responded: &quot;Oh, but I don't even know what you mean by dance education. There is no way that I can teach dance to my students.&quot; This opinion was echoed at a New Zealand primary school arts educators' conference and teachers involved in the consultation rounds of the new curriculum.</p>
 

<p>
Another comment I found interesting, this time from a keen and experienced teacher of dance in her classroom: &quot;Time &#8211; I can't find extra time to teach it, and my conditioning that maths and language MUST be done before all else, still gets me.&quot;</p>


<p>
What happens to dance within schools in the next few years, will, I believe, have an immense impact on the future of dance in New Zealand. Teachers out there now, are the teachers who will next week, next month, and next year start realising what the reality is for the implementation of dance in the primary school system.</p>


<p>
Staff rooms are humming with anxious, excited, and terrified conversations about their perceptions of teaching dance in their classroom. I hear all too often comments like: &quot;What is dance?&quot;, &quot;I can't dance, so there is no way that I can teach it&quot;, &quot;I don't have any space/ music/ steps/ ideas/ support/ time/ resources/ experience&quot;, and one of my favourites, albeit facetious, &quot;I don't have my tutu&quot;.</p>


<p>
This is the context into which dance will be introduced. In the short term the teachers want recipes and answers that will get them through the next lesson. In teaching, I don't think we can presume to have standard answers for the complexity of issues that arise in every classroom. It is a messy business and you learn what works and doesn't work for yourself pretty quickly.</p>
 

<p>
This research will, however, capture the reality for a number of teachers and examine themes, commonalities, and differences in their experience of teaching dance.</p>

<h3>My context and questions</h3>

<p>
I am a teacher. I have taught primary and secondary school children, adults and children with intellectual and physical disabilities, elderly people, teachers, and tertiary students. I have taught throughout Australia and New Zealand in the capacity of classroom teacher, visiting guest artist, teacher in-service provider, dance specialist, and recreation centre coach and coordinator. I have taught across the curriculum, yet I have found an affinity with dance in the education context and over the years developed a degree of expertise in dance in the primary school context.</p>


<p>
Over the last 10 years I have written dance curriculum, dance resource kits, dance books, talked at conferences, and taught many classrooms and many teachers. During these years I noticed that teachers had an ongoing reticence to teach dance, and confusion about what it entailed. </p>


<p>
These observations prompted me to reflect on my own knowledge of the reality of teaching dance in the classroom. What assumptions do I have, do curriculum developers and dance in-service providers have about the teacher who has to teach dance, who wants to teach dance and who avoids teaching dance?</p>

<h3>An overview of the study</h3>


<p>
The questions above have prompted this study into primary school teachers' meaning of dance in their classroom. In the context of New Zealand, this is a timely study as the new arts curriculum asks teachers to address and teach dance. As my question above implies, my study is approaching the teaching of dance from the teachers' perspective. </p>


<p>
I am not looking at dance from a curriculum theory perspective or a pre-service teacher education point of view. I am choosing to gain insight into teachers' lived experiences of teaching dance in their classrooms. What is the reality for the teacher? And what are the barriers or supports that the teacher identifies from their practice? In this regard I refer to educational researchers Connelly, Clandinin and He (1997) who state: &quot;...the main ways to improve education through research is to study the construction and expression of teacher knowledge&quot; (p. 666). They support the need to start directly with teachers' practice in order to capture the experiential view.</p>
 

<p>
Working directly with teachers as research participants allows the research to see what teachers know and how their knowledge is realised in their teaching. Connelly, Clandinin and He go on to say: &quot;Our research shows that to more closely relate ideas about teaching and learning, with practice of teaching and learning, we need to be concerned with what it is that teachers know and with the knowledge environment in which they work&quot; (1997, p. 674). </p>


<p>
This research aims to explore teachers' meanings of dance in their everyday workplace context.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>
<h3>Method: A brief introduction</h3>


<p>
This is a phenomenological study that values the words, action and practice of primary school teachers (Maykut &amp; Morehouse, 1994; Schon, 1983; Clandinin &amp; Connelly, 1985, 1995). The study takes a constructivist approach (Schwandt, 1994; Eisner, 1998; Crotty, 1999) wherein the teachers and I will examine each other's understandings and create shared meanings (Howe &amp; Berv, 2000).</p>


<p>
The study is centred in Dunedin, New Zealand and involves nine teachers &#8211; case studies (Stake, 1994) from four schools. Co-structured interviews (Tripp, 1983) participant observation (Tolich, 1999) and shared dances (Eisner, 1998) will provide the data for analysis. Maykut and Morehouse's (1994) constant comparative method of data analysis will allow for an inductive emergence of themes negotiated by teachers and myself.</p>


<p>
The study is focusing upon experienced practising teachers in order to capture the reality of the primary school classroom. The meaning of dance for experienced teachers who are on the whole unexperienced dance educators is relatively unexplored in the literature. Yet I believe that it is vital to establish what teachers' &quot;constructions&quot; of dance are if the curriculum visions as stated in the curriculum are to be realised. It is vital because the actuality of the classroom matters.</p>
 

<p>
The face-to-face, minute-by-minute interaction between the teacher and student and dance is at the heart of dance education. In listening to and respecting teachers' constructions of dance in the classroom we honour the knowledge they have, which includes their tacit unspoken knowledge (Polanyi, 1985). </p>


<p>
Recognising teachers' daily reality empowers their practice and encourages their journey toward implementing the dance curriculum.</p>

<h3>Initial observations</h3>


<p>
I have collected data from seven teachers and am currently collecting data from two more teachers. The teachers that I am working with have diverse interests and experience in dance and teaching dance. In this study, I have chosen to limit the number of teachers involved to nine so as I can spend maximum time with each teacher in order to develop deeper and more trusting collaborative research relationships. </p>


<p>
The following observations are taken from my journal entries and initial interview transcriptions. They indicate key ideas that are arising, yet are not to be taken as major themes or categories for analysis as I have not commenced this process yet. 
</p>

<p>
My observations are briefly stated and identified with each teacher as outlined below.</p>


<p>
<b>Kate</b><br>
Kate teaches 8- to 10-year-old students in an 8-teacher school in a lower to middle socio-economic city suburb. Kate describes herself as someone who &quot;does not dance, does not like to dance &#8211; even when I'm out drinking&quot;. She has never taught dance and only wants to know the minimum requirements. Kate admitted the challenge she gave herself in volunteering for the study, but did so in order to know what to do when she had to teach dance.</p>


<p>
Initial observations</p>

<ul><li>&quot;Dance involves a lot of thinking. I would never have thought that it involved so much thinking, talking, problem solving and negotiation.&quot;</li>
<li>Kate was very honest about her disinterest in dance with her students &#8211; which was a positive start to her dance program.</li>
<li>Kate was concerned about controlling the class and limiting &quot;silliness&quot;.</li></ul>

<p>
<b>Gessie</b><br>
Gessie teaches 5- to 6-year-old students in the same school as Kate. Gessie is a relatively inexperienced teacher with minimal experience in teaching dance, but has a newfound &quot;love&quot; of dance after watching a professional modern dance performance six months ago.</p>


<p>
Initial observations</p>

<ul>
<li>The importance of seeing quality dance performances in theatres is important for teachers and students.</li>
<li>Gessie translated teaching strategies across curriculum areas once she had a lesson structure and strong starting point.</li>
<li>Gessie commented that the most beneficial in-service activity would be to watch an expert teach a dance lesson in the classroom context and then to have an expert watch her and give feedback. She commented: &quot;I have never seen another teacher teach dance in a classroom.&quot;</li>
<li>All students participated.</li>
<li>At the end of the data collection process Gessie indicated that her notion of education was SO much wider now.</li></ul>


<p>
<b>Lolla</b><br>
Lolla teaches 5- to 7-year-olds also in this same school. Lolla is a leading &quot;model&quot; teacher in the school. She has considerable experience, is an accomplished visual arts teacher and has committed herself to being a leading dance teacher. Lolla is currently a regional support teacher for the dance curriculum.</p>


<p>
Initial observations</p>

<ul>
<li>Transitions from one curriculum area from the next require precise management.</li>
<li>Lolla continually checked for students' detailed understanding of tasks and topics.</li>
<li>Lolla stated she ideally would like in-service sessions that focused upon teaching dance in the classroom rather than doing dance activity oriented sessions.</li></ul>


<p>
<b>Ethel</b><br>
Ethel teaches 5- and 6-year-olds. Ethel is a very experienced teacher, with established procedures and planning structures. She is very structured in her planning on paper, relatively conservative in her approach, and knows dance as an aspect of physical education.</p>


<p>
Initial observations</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Dancing is about steps&quot; (the steps that she gives).</li>
<li>&quot;Music provides the key stimulus for creative dance.&quot;</li>
<li>Ethel has expectations about who dances. This is specifically in regard to body type and gender.</li></ul>


<p>
<b>Joe</b><br>
A teacher and school principal, Joe teaches 11- and 12-year-olds maths. He is very keen on visual art and has a music interest in his personal life. He encourages teacher professional development in all curriculum areas.</p>


<p>
Initial observations</p>
<ul>
<li>He finds the curriculum lacking in providing a clear progression of dance development. &quot;If they start with nothing in year 1 what is it that they should have by year 6?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Resources are an issue, aren't they?&quot;</li></ul>


<p>
<b>Micki</b><br>
Micki teaches all ages and is a permanent part-time teacher. Micki particularly enjoys teaching visual arts and M&#257;ori and makes these her focus when she teaches. Micki has little experience in teaching dance, though believes that it is a very important and rich curriculum area. She does not know where to start.</p>


<p>
Initial observations</p>
<ul>
<li>She did not know where to start but she started. Also, she started with the students' knowledge.</li>
<li>Noted the impact of dance on Alexander and saw him as a different learner.</li></ul>


<p>
<b>Paul</b><br>
Paul teaches with Micki. He is the teaching principal of a small school. He teaches 7- to 11-year-olds. Paul is very self -conscious and while an experienced teacher, has very limited experience in teaching dance, which has mainly been within the physical education context.</p>


<p>
Initial observations</p>
<ul>
<li>Paul separates his personal and professional &quot;landscapes&quot; (Clandinin &amp; Connelly, 1995).</li>
<li>He, with much surprise, &quot;actually enjoyed making the dance&quot;.</li>
<li>He is concerned with what others think of his involvement to the extent that it potentially stops his involvement. He did not believe that his movement ideas were dance movement ideas.</li></ul>

<h3>Implications for dance in primary schools in New Zealand</h3>


<p>
While it is too early to fully identify the implications that the findings in this study may have for teachers, I will outline some possible issues and directions that could be of relevance to teachers of dance in the primary school context.</p>


<h4>In-service content</h4>


<p>
The aim of this study was not to provide in-service training nor facilitate change in the teachers' practice. Nonetheless change did occur as we reflected upon and observed the teaching process and worked through a dance-making process. </p>


<p>
All of the teachers commented on the research process as being enjoyable and very helpful. As such, an implication for dance education teacher professional development may be to include more activities that focus on reflecting upon personal practice and the practice of an expert.</p>


<p>
 As Gessie commented, &quot;I've never seen anyone else teach dance, let alone an expert.&quot; We talked about planning and teaching and observed each other teach and gave feedback to each other. Teachers like Kate and Micki taught dance lessons and continued to teach many more. They experienced quite a deal of success that came as a genuine surprise to themselves.</p>
 <p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>
<h4>Resources</h4>


<p>
Every teacher raised the issue of resources. They overwhelmingly needed music, music, and more music. When I pressed the teachers to talk about what they would do with the music, and what kind of music they want and for what kind of dance class they started to unpack what they expected from the music. Most teachers found that they relied on music to provide the movement inspiration; they relied on music to provide crowd control, to provide lesson structures, to provide dance steps, to provide the dance class. </p>


<p>
Music remains an issue, but the teachers refined their expectation of music and began to focus on the dance and the movement first and then found music to complement the dance. Their practise by their own admission was to start with the music and then find the movement. They also started to trust their own personal music collection rather than seek out music especially for dance classes &#8211; that they mostly found frustrating, as they had to spend too much time sifting through short tunes devoid of atmosphere. </p>


<p>
The teachers also wanted &quot;ideas&quot; books &#8211; short, snappy, open-at-any-page, and get-an-activity type books. At the beginning this was more important than at the end of the data collection. Gessie and Micki summed up the shift when they made similar comments to the effect that &quot;everywhere you look in the classroom are dance ideas&quot; and &quot;the students are the best resource&quot;. </p>


<p>
The implication for dance education is to draw teachers' attention to the activities they already do, and see the dance potential in the themes that they already cover, and also to SEE the children, see their ideas and use them.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>
<h4>Ask, use, and pattern</h4>


<p>
Lolla observed my teaching and said, &quot;You know Ralph, the thing that I really like about your teaching is the way you use the students' ideas and somehow turn them into a dance.&quot; </p>


<p>
This comment caused me to reflect on my own teaching. I said to Lolla the next day, &quot;I think the key to my using the kids' ideas is asking for them in the first place. Do you ever consciously ask them to offer dance ideas?&quot; </p>


<p>
Lolla and I talked about this for ages and we arrived at the &quot;Ask, use, and pattern&quot; expression. Ask the students for ideas, then acknowledge the ideas and use them and then pattern them. This pedagogical cycle keeps spiralling until the dance is made or whatever.</p>
 

<p>
The implication here is that a catchy little phrase like this may be a handy device for teachers to use in maintaining their focus on the students' work, and on structuring activities. It may help teachers to SEE the students' ideas and may relieve them of the feeling that they have to do all the creative thinking.</p>

<h4>Control</h4>


<p>
Most of the teachers expressed a concern about controlling the class and maintaining discipline. An implication for in-service and teacher assistance is to address strategies and approaches to the curriculum that are management focused rather than dance ideas focused. An issue I observed was the creation of &quot;classroom rules or behaviour contracts&quot; that were pinned on the wall of every classroom. Most of them referred to quietness, keeping hands to yourself and so on.</p>


<p>
During several dance classes I observed a sense of confusion created by the teacher. Confusion came from contrasting messages, for example &quot;move in a different way&quot; to which the kids would explore, fall, and laugh and try again. The teacher would quickly say &quot;not so silly&quot;, and &quot;ssssh &#8211; too noisy&quot;. The teachers give mixed messages about what &quot;explore&quot; is and what dance can be.</p>
 

<p>
The teacher's notion of what it is to be a teacher may be squashing the very nature of what dance is for the students.</p>

<h4>What is education?</h4>


<p>
A very interesting effect on the teachers in this study was that they began seriously questioning education practice in the classroom. Gessie in her final interview commented on how much she learnt during the collection of data. She commented: &quot;For me the thing that I got out of this, is that I used to think education was this&quot; (she made a round shape with her hands as if holding a saucer with two hands) &quot;NOW, I see education as being this&quot; (she expanded her arms as if to hold a beach ball).</p>
 

<p>
Paul expressed with delight his surprise at his own achievement in making a dance and indicated to the effect &quot;I wish I had done this at school&quot;. </p>


<p>
Kate after completing a dance making activity stated: &quot;It involves so much thinking.&quot;</p>
 

<p>
Dance is bringing something to these teachers' conception of education. They are seeing opportunities that didn't exist.</p>

<h3>Concluding observations</h3>


<p>
In finishing, I want to mention two students in two different schools. Alexander is a 6-year-old boy in Gessie's class with Williams's syndrome (similar to autism). Alexander could not speak but could communicate with sign and gesture. He did not participate in classroom activity with the other students. He is a delightful boy and has a full time teacher aide. He participated in Gessie's dance class. This may not seem unusual, but the teacher aide's face registered the fact that the participation was more than unusual. I asked her about it and she commented that she had never before seen Alexander do what he is doing in this class. The point being that dance offered this boy an opportunity to at last participate and learn along with his peers.</p>


<p>
The other boy is James (10-years-old), in Micki's class. He is streetwise, alert, yet disruptive, less than academically orientated and prone to extreme mood swings. To cut a long story short Micki and Paul could not believe James' contribution to the dance class. &quot;His movements are just so fantastic&quot;, Micki said more than once. His participation and his ideas had the effect of altering how Micki and Paul &quot;saw&quot; James. They had to acknowledge that he was a different boy in the dance classroom. He was a boy with ideas and he knew how to organise them using his body. He was less restless and was a keen fan of the dance class. These teachers saw a boy with an educational strength, and a way that he enjoyed participating and learning. Here, the impact was that both Micki and Paul realised that they needed to reassess their notion of what education could be for their students and how different curriculum can connect with different students.</p>


<p>
Both Alexander and James illustrate the potential for dance in the curriculum. A potential found by very inexperienced teachers of dance who did not set out to challenge their conceptions of students nor education. This study is raising issues that centre on the teacher, the dance, and the learner. In the classroom, they interact in complex and ever shifting relationships.</p>
 

<p>
Teachers are the experts in their classroom, they know a diverse curriculum and they know the students. They provide the bridge and the stepping-stones in education. As Willis and Schubert (1991) state &quot;... they are at the heart of education&quot; (p. 6).</p>
 

<p>
This study, in examining teachers' meanings of dance in their classroom, aims to help teachers embrace dance education, to embrace the potential of all students, and to reflect upon the art of teaching dance. The study is also revealing that dance is bringing something to the classroom and to education.</p>
