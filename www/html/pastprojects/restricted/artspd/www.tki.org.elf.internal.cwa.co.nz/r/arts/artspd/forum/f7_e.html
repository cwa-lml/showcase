<h2 class="h2-forum">Helping children to see</h2>

<p><a href="index_e.html">Back to Archived Forum Discussion index</a></p>

<p>Excerpts from forum discussion with Ann Brodie (National Coordinator &#8211; The Visual Arts)<br>
28 November 2001</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b><br> 
Welcome to the visual arts forum. Ann Brodie, National Coordinator &#8211; The Visual Arts, will be our special guest.</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie: </b><br>
Welcome to the forum! It's great for me to be back, after a longer time off line than you have had. It will be good to frame the forum around "helping children to see". I have been working intensively on one aspect of this topic while developing exemplars in schools; that is, the concept of depth or showing space in a picture. 
Let's talk under two headings: starters and strategies.</p> 

<p>Starters: say you have selected your theme or topic and your subject matter and the learning ideas are identified. In this case, the focus is on depth.</p> 

<p>Strategies: I would like to discuss with you:<br> 
<ol>
<li>in what sorts of ways could you begin to assist the children to see the effect of depth in real life;</li><br><br> 
<li>how you could help them to look carefully and thoughtfully and see that identical objects look different when close to when they are far away(like trees or people or houses or hills);</li><br><br>
<li>how could you help them to <b>show</b> that distance, in an art work;</li><br><br>
<li>how could they treat the far objects so that they seem to be further away.</li><br><br>
</ol>
</P>

<p>Is this clear or do you have some questions for me? I dont want this to be scarey 'cos I have been working on this and I want to open it up for you so we can share and I can have your input, to help me.</p> 

<p><b>Carol Langton: </b><br>
Dear Ann. Are there plans in place for on-going PD structures and/or assistance after the contracts are finished? </p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b><br> 
The actual plans are not in place but the need for them is very clear and planning is underway. It will take longer than the allocated two years to get all schools up and running and confident. </p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie: </b><br>
Tarnia,  I understand you are new to the forum.  Do you have any thoughts on children becoming aware of how to represent depth? </p>

<p><b>Tarnia: </b><br>
Hi Ann. Teaching in the junior school I know they have trouble understanding and drawing things such as far away trees in their pictures. I think it is important to ask right from new entrant level "what's behind that person or object?". Once they have this awareness they can work on it in terms of proportion, etcetera.</p> 

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b><br> 
Great to hear that you question them to help them to become aware . And "what is behind?" is a great first question.

<p>I have two level 2 exemplars being made, one deals with overlapping and the other with foreground and background with further away things being smaller than near things.</p>

<p><b>Greg:</b><br>
Ann, where can we get or see these exemplars?</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b><br>
Greg, the exemplars are being made at present and will be trialled in some schools next year and then in schools in 2003. I think they are exciting, especially in the visual arts. <a href="http://www.tki.org.nz/r/assessment/exemplars/index_e.php">http://www.tki.org.nz/r/assessment/exemplars/index_e.php</a></p>

<p><b>Greg:</b><br> 
At the present time my visual arts role is more in the presenting of arts work in, and around, the classroom. I am trying to help develop an awareness of colour, form, balance and looks. Also, visual arts to me is the look of things like advertising and movies. 
</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie: </b><br>
So what level Greg and have you deliberately tried to help you children to see how to show depth?</p> 

<p><b>Greg:</b><br> 
I have a year 4&#8211;8 class with 19 children, bliss I know for lots. 
I have been operating between levels 2&#8211;4 because of the childrens' ages. I can't take the credit for some of the work that the children are doing. We have some making a papier-m&acirc;ch&aacute; couch, some working with clay (my next year's teacher has started early). 
I also have my wife working with the still-life, using different media, for example, sponges to dab.  I have also worked on portraits using pencil sketching and getting the children to use different tone to develop the depth.</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b><br> 
Hi Greg. I guess that in portraiture, depth could also be termed "form". 
I know of teachers who use cut-outs of objects to teach or explain depth, for example, trees same size when at same depth. But when one is overlapped by, say,  a house, and the other is in front of the house, the children have to think about whether the idea of one being further back is working when they are still the same size. Problem solving!</p> 

<p><b>Greg:</b><br> 
Yes I agree, problem solving is most important. I also find it interesting when you give children some instructions, to have the subject taking up most of the page, to have foreground objects large and background small, and also to have some pieces of background or foreground partially on the page, for example, half of a fish. The children find it difficult, unless you give them something to look at to get an idea of what you mean. When the children start to get their ideas flowing, they can produce some awesome work.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b><br> 
You're on to it Greg, using some sort of artist model example as well as reality observations is a rich approach.</p>


<p><b>Carol Langton: </b><br>
I agree that the topic "depth" is really interesting and can be difficult to teach.  When teaching drawing, we like to go outside for the experience of distance, feeling and looking at the distance, but when we can't do this, does anyone have any ideas as to how to show distance and depth inside the classroom? Lighting comes to mind.</p>

<p><b>Tarnia:</b><br> 
Hi Carol, could you please expand on your lighting thought?</p>

<p><b>Carol Langton:</b><br> 
My idea about lighting is to use it on objects inside to create really strong shadows and make the effects of foreground, background, close, distant &#8211; more obvious.

<p><b>Ann Brodie: </b><br>
I see what you want the lighting to do.  It always simplifies the task of showing depth or the form of shapes as well as near being lit, so "far" is less defined.</p> 

<p><b>Carol Langton:</b><br> 
Ann, when would you advise that teachers show children about using scale proportions in their drawings and/or perspective formulas?</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b><br> 
Carol, actually I have never been a formula person I prefer that by discovery and good formative questioning the children are led to see and then want to explore ways of doing. I think to be bigger and smaller without being specific is the way to go first.  Perspective formulae belong a bit further up but the principle of perspective can be observed as reality quite early. I have a level 4 exemplar which has some one point perspective.</p>

<p><b>Carol Langton:</b><br> 
About teaching formula, I'm glad to hear you say there are other ways Ann. Thanks. Children discover for themselves and learn in ways more sophisticated than we sometimes give them credit. Observation and meaningful stimulation and motivation go a long way. Also experimenting with shade and tone and overlapping, making collages or scaled stage sets and other 3D landscapes is a good starter for using depth in art.</p>

<p><b>Tarnia:</b><br> 
Once they are aware of depth they need to be aware of use of skills for colour and detail to make depth. The further the object the less detail. The use of lines and tone would also need to be taught?</p> 

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b><br> 
Yes, that's a good statement about detail and the use of colour once they get into representing depth. You have both blurring with distance "see those far trees can you see the leaves?"; and blueing with distance (from oxygen) "do the far hills look the same colour as the ones in the next paddock?"</p>

<p><b>Carol Langton:</b><br> 
By the time someone asked me "Do the far hills look that same colour as the near paddock..." I was in university art class! Up till then I think we just copied from photographs. Those type of questions and the formative assessment of the process is so important.</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b> <br>
Yes I agree, Carol.  In fact I find children can intellectualise about depth, all the observable things we have discussed today, but that does not mean they have the multi-faceted awareness to make it happen in an art work. Read a great paper by Linda Ashton (Australia) on this. I liked what I read. It's about helping them to be able to record reality once they want to and then letting them loose in creative use of this (or ignoring of this!) knowledge.</p>

<p><b>Sue Cheesman:</b><br> 
I often think about distance when looking through a camera and I never think to look past the immediate image, that is, what is in the background.</p>


<p><b>Greg:</b><br> 
Hi Sue, you're right about the photo aren't you, but for those absolutely awesome photos, the background is what makes it great.</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b><br> 
They say it is photography that spelled the death of realism but children still strive to represent reality. A developmental need, I think. I must say in my own painting I avoid laborious tasks that a camera would serve for. 
Have any of you tried the pinch test where you squint and look at a distant object with your thumb "on " the bottom of it and your finger on the "top of it then you keep the digits locked in terms of distance apart and swing your "measurer" (on the same plane) and measure another object.  Sure demonstrates difference in scale! Is that understandable?</p>

<p><b>Carol Langton:</b><br> 
Yes, that is understandable, Ann.  And how about the old square cut into the middle of a piece of paper, for focusing in on detail. I know it has nothing to do with depth but it sure helps children to isolate an interesting texture or abstract shape.</p>

<p><b>Kerren:</b><br> 
Hi there, everybody.  I know I am a bit late it is 5:07 and the forum has probably closed, but I have enjoyed reading everybody's comments.  I am a year 5/6 homeroom teacher at an Area school and I do have access to a specialist graphics/visual teacher, so I am lucky in that respect. But I still find it difficult to actually teach the kids art when I find I don't know all the technical aspects of art itself. If anybody can suggest some good teaching resources for middle/upper school that they have found useful I would be very appreciative. i do have drawing on the right hand side of the brain but more would be good.</p> 

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b><br> 
I suggest Kerren, that you buy <i>Painting my Teacher Blue</i> from Auckland College of Education's Resource Centre. It will be very helpful.</p> 

<p><b>Val Duthie: </b><br>
Kerren, you'll find a description of the book Ann has recommended on the Arts Online site. Check the URL below and you will get a summary of the book's contents.<br>
