<p><a href="index_e.html">Back to Archived Forum Discussion index</a></p>

<p>Excerpts from forum discussion with Tina Hong (National Coordinator &#8211; Dance)<br>
6 March 2002</p>



<p><b>Val Duthie:</b>
<br>
Welcome to Tina's forum. This is the first of a series of forums focusing on dance. This week's focus will be: Developing practical knowledge in Dance. Our special guest is Tina Hong the (National Coordinator &#8211; Dance). To gain more value from the discussion you may wish to look at: </p>

<ul>
<li><i>The Arts in the New Zealand Curriculum</i>, page 20<br><br>
</li>

<li>the exemplars from the National Exemplar trials on 
<br>
<a href="http://www.tki.org.elf.internal.cwa.co.nz/r/assessment/exemplars/arts/dance/edv_2a_e.html">http://www.tki.org.nz/r/assessment/exemplars/arts/dance/edv_2a_e.html</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In this exemplar the students actively explore the elements of: body awareness (with a focus on body shapes) and space (with a focus on floor pathways). </p>

<p><b>Sue Cheesman:</b>
<br>
Body shapes is a concept that teachers find easy to relate to and there are so many examples of contrasting shapes that children and teachers can choose from to explore. Do you think that using a concrete image such as a long nail or a beach ball helps initially? </p>

<p>

<b>Tina Hong:</b>
<br>
My answer would be "Yes". I would encourage the use of concrete images &#8211; particularly for earlier experiences when students (no matter what age!) are initially exploring body shapes (Element: Body Awareness). I tend to use: Pin (long/thin); Ball (round); Wall (wide); and Twisted (combination of previous) as images for student exploration. These cover the basic shapes and they can be done in any number of ways &#8211; different levels, size etcetera. </p>

<p>After some initial exploration it is also interesting to then have students explore and develop movement transitions from one shape to another, for example, "Can you make a ball shape and then make a jerky transition into a wall shape?"</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Sue Cheesman:</b> <br>

Yes, that is great. Also, a fun activity is to vary the time they take between shapes. With younger ones I find that shells are interesting to use as stimulus for shape work. For older children how would you suggest we approach this work?</p>

<p><b>Phil:</b>
<br>I have not taught dance before so I am very tentative about it. I am looking, firstly, at exploring personal space and have been trying out the moving-within-the-space-bubble scenario, and cardboard boxes as another idea. Can you suggest resources that would be helpful for me as I start on this exploration?</p>

<p><b>Tina Hong:</b>
<br>
I've assumed that you have checked out the learning examples on the TKI Unwrapping the Arts: Dance site? Also, if you take a look at the dance bibliography on the Arts Online site there are some useful text resources cited there. You might interloan them via your local/regional library. There are more TKI examples in the pipeline and these should become available in the next few months. We are also in the final stages of getting two dance videos (Years 1&#8211;6 and Years 7&#8211;10) and a booklet published which will be sent out to all schools, most probably next term. I'm sure that these will provide you with some useful starting points.</p>

<p><b>Phil:</b>
<br>
Yes, I've checked out the exemplars and TKI site. It'll be good to receive the new resources when they come out too.</p>

<p><b>Ann N:</b> <br>

I find my kids are very keen on dancing around the classroom. I am keen to structure this but do not want to use the latest pop music. Do you have any suggestions of how I might do this in relation to the ideas in today's forum? </p>

<p><b>Tina Hong:</b>
<br>
Kids love to dance! I'm not sure how old your kids are but I'd suggest you use their enthusiasm and as you say 'structure it'. On the first of the two videos coming out soon (that I mentioned in my reply to Phil) there's an example of how a teacher has used the hip-hop idea and contemporary music. He begins by having the kids look at some music video clips that have dance sequences in them and identifying the different types of jumps that are used. Five basics are: same foot to same foot; two feet to two feet; one foot to different foot; two feet to one foot; and one foot to two feet. Students then explored these, developed short sequences in pairs or trios and finally ended up creating larger group and finally a whole class dance in a la hip hop style to funky music. </p>

<p>What this does is work backwards by having the children examine not only the context (and there's a lot that could be done, such as researching hip-hop dance via the Internet) but also look at breaking down the movement patterns and techniques as in the attention to the jumps. Might this be an appropriate beginning for you?</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Ann N: </b>
<br>
I look forward to the videos. My kids are a range of ages. Anyway, you have given me some ideas of where to begin. </p>

<p>

<b>Parvin:</b>
<br>
Our school, at this stage, has no Arts Curriculum Overview and I am the newly appointed Principal. Francis from Team Solutions has been scheduled to meet with our staff over the new few weeks to create and implement a new overview and scheme for the school. How relevant, then, it is at this stage to be taking part in this forum, which sounds very exciting and a wonderful learning experience. Are we jumping the gun? </p>

<p>

2. From my brief knowledge of the document, and the small staffing entitlement we have, how can we actually do justice to the correct teaching strategies of dance? Our small PD budget does not allow for this undertaking this year. Your views and suggestions will be super.</p>


<b>Tina Hong:</b>
<br>
It's great to hear that you're making a start on the Arts Curriculum. I think you'll find the conversation that occurs during the forum informative, both from the point of view of the experiences and questions that other teachers/schools post, and the responses that I, and others make. We're all learning, so, no, I don't think that you're "jumping the gun". Hop on board and take the journey with us! </p>

<p>As for the small budget, you may not want to do the whole PD contract and major implementation push this year but you can certainly begin to try out some activities/approaches in a small way. I'm sure that Francis will give you a good steer about what might be manageable given your current circumstances and then you can plan for more substantial implementation a little later.</p>

<p>
<b>Chris:</b>
<br>
We are a two-teacher school. Like Parvin, we don't have an implementation plan yet. </p>

<p>In the midst of our busy lives we are getting a handle on the forums and beginning to talk about The Arts. </p>

<p>

We have some talented singers here and each Christmas there is an event called "Carols in the Caves". The school children join with the adult choir and sing for three nights in the cathedral cavern of our world famous glow-worm cave. </p>

<p>We also have a parent who has an MA in the fine arts from Oxford University and we make use of her in the school, too. </p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p>

<b>Val Duthie:</b>
<br>
What lucky folks you are in having such creative folks in your community: a real bonus for you. You are also fortunate to have such a wonderland as a stage for your productions. What more do you need? </p>

<p>

<b>Chris:</b>
<br>
We have some folk in our community who are into line dancing. I thought we might ask them to come in next term and do some work with our kids. A neighbouring school will be running a festival of the arts in Term 4 and I hope that we will have a line dancing presentation to offer. </p>

<p>

<b>Christine:</b>
<br>
I teach juniors. Last year my class enjoyed making up a dance using free expression with a programme called <i>Move and Relax with Music</i>. It was very successful. I am here to find out further ideas to get started.</p>

<p><b>Tina Hong:</b>
<br>
I'm not familiar with the resource that you mention. Can you tell me a wee bit more about what you did and where you want to head this year?</p>

<p><b>Christine:</b>
<br>
The resource mentioned (which I found in our Physical Education section) is from Curriculum Concepts, dated 1996. There are themes such as <i>At the Zoo,</i> <i>Space Travel,</i> <i>At the Playground,</i> and <i>The Robots.</i> There is an accompanying tape with the music and directions in a booklet of instructions of actions to do when the voice says a certain phrase. The children loved it. It is a combination of dance and drama, but then that is what dance is, drama in time to music. I am actually gaining from reading your replies to other people.

</p>

<p><b>Tina Hong:</b>
<br>
Resources are the biggest 'ask' for dance from around the country. Can you tell me more specifically what would be of most use to you?</p>

<p><b>Chris:</b>
<br>
Those old folk dance records and tapes that had the instruction book were good. </p>

<p>I remember a couple of schools ago using "New Wave" folk dances which had an accompanying book with pictures, diagrams and instructions. I think resources with "how to do" ideas are the most useful in our busy lives. 

</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Christine:</b> <br>

I am interested in classical music. During the last holidays, there was a programme on Concert FM telling the stories of different ballets along with the music. I happened to hear <i>Swan Lake</i> then school started and I was unable to listen to the next one. I thought what a great idea especially if it was transferred to video so that the students can actually have the dance explained to them as they viewed it. Is there any such resource available? </p>

<p><b>Tina Hong:</b>

<br>There are commercial videos available of the ballets. The story ballets are particularly good because they obviously have a narrative that the children can follow and then talk about. You might also look at the new CD-ROM resource put out by the Royal New Zealand Ballet. </p>

<p><b>Sue Cheesman:</b>
<br>
Here is the reference for information about the Royal New Zealand Ballet CD-ROM on the Arts online site: <a href="../events/new_e.html">http://www.tki.org.nz/r/arts/artspd/events/new_e.php</a></p>

<p><b>Christine:</b> <br>

What does it mean to change the dynamic in dance? I know the term in music, not dance. 
</p>

<p><b>Tina Hong:</b>
<br>
Dynamics in dance relates to the quality of the dance. In our New Zealand curriculum it is broken down into Time and Energy as the element. So, in short, Time plus Energy equals Dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Pip:
</b><br>It's great to see the exemplars up on line now... thank you! I like the way they show clear progressions, and are obviously set within an authentic learning situation involving the whole class. Can't wait for the video resource! </p>

<p><b>Sue Cheesman:</b> <br>

Great to get a range of questions. My thoughts on chance methods are that they are a way of ordering the movements. For example, you may have six different shapes and label them one to six and throw a dice six times to see the order you would dance them in. This is one example I know of that works. </p>

<p><b>Tina Hong:</b>
<br>
Aha &#8211; you've been reading the curriculum! Chance method (or aleatory method) is rather like a "lucky dip" approach to dance making. Literally, the choreography is structured purely by chance.</p>

<p>There are lots of ways but one way that is often used involves the casting of dice to determine the movement material or structure of the dance. For example, you might have already developed some simple movement material but how you then proceed to manipulate the material to make it into a longer sequence, or dance, happens according to the roll of the dice. You allocate a particular way of doing movement to each number ahead of time, for example: 1 = repetition; 2 = doing the movement backwards: 3 = changing the dynamic; 4 = changing directions etcetera. The process then begins by rolling the dice and incorporating the instruction into the dance work. </p>

<p>The American choreographer Merce Cunningham has worked a lot with chance or aleatory methods. It's a very interesting way of working, with often surprising and dynamic results. When I've worked in this way with students they have all really enjoyed it. </p>
