<h2 class="h2-forum">How to use a drawing as a basis for work in another medium</h2>

<p><a href="index_e.html">Back to Archived Forum Discussion index</a></p>

<p>Excerpts from forum discussion with Ann Brodie (National Coordinator &#8211; The Visual Arts)<br>
17 April 2002</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b> 
<br>
Welcome to Term 2 and the first of our Arts Forums for this term. Ann Brodie, National Coordinator &#8211; The Visual Arts is our guest online this week. Our focus will be: "Have done the drawing, what is next?" Discussion will centre on how to use a drawing as a basis for work in another medium. As a background to this session, it would be useful to look at the following Ministry of Education resources that you have in school:</p> 

<ol type="1">
<li><i>Exploring the Visual Arts in years 1&#8211;6:</i> booklets in Painting, Printmaking and Sculpture;<br><br>
</li>


<li><i>Design and Graphics in Technology: A Resource for Teachers of years 1&#8211;8,</i> pages 50&#8211;53.</li>
</ol> 


<p><b>Carol Langton:</b> 
<br>
I would like to ask a simple question about the drawings students use for references to other works. Do you call them "working drawings"?</p> 

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b> 
<br>
Yes, the term "working drawings" is customary &#8211; or preparatory studies.</p>

<p><b>Phil:</b> 
<br>
I looked up the definition of a drawing in the glossary at the back of one of the resource booklets mentioned and it provides this explanation: "Drawing is a sketch, plan, photograph, computer generated image, diagram or model created in order to develop an idea or as an end is itself". This provides some clarification for me, and some confusion. I hadn't considered photographs as drawings although I can see how sketches, plans and computer images could be and how they could be used as a basis for work in another medium. Can you give me your thoughts on this?</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b> 
<br>
That whole widening out of drawing to include photography came about during the writing of unit standards. We need to acknowledge that photographers prepare art photos (proof sheets) not with "drawings".</p>

<p><b>Audrie:</b> 
<br>
We've been working on drawing and sketching and would like to move into 3D work with clay. What types of activities should we use to get the links between the two different mediums of pencil on paper to modelling with clay?</p> 

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b> 
<br>
I suggest you look at the trial visual arts exemplar on clay animals and see that the initial preparatory drawings were to discover texture and shape and pattern. These are needed for translation to 3D thinking and action.</p>

<p><b>Christine:</b> 
<br>
I am teaching Year 1 &#8211; 3. I have just finished a very successful unit using sketches as a basis for developing clay models as part of the National Exemplar project that our school was involved in. Take a look at the Visual Arts Exemplars on clay. There are excellent guidelines. I found the children enjoyed exploring texture and tone through their sketches and were able to apply these skills to their models. What impressed us (I had a help from a parent who is a qualified artist) was seeing the progression and the improvement of their work. I am very impressed with the support the National Exemplars gave in this curriculum area.</p> 

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b> 
<br>
I am interested that you used researched images of animals for the preparation. The task of recording from a 2D source is different to the task of responding to a 3D source. In the Level 1 exemplar, Clay Animals, the student featured drew a swimming turtle. The legs as a result are not well seen, and no wonder. When she made her sculpture the student had to make the feet differently to the drawn ones. She realised they had to be weight bearing and functional. In reality they need to do both types of recording, from life (or 3D) and from books etcetera, 2D.</p> 

<p><b>Audrie:</b> 
<br>
What theme did you use or was it straight from the ideas given?</p> 

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Christine:</b> 
<br>
We used the same theme as the booklet offered. Originally we were going to use insects as a theme to link to our topic, however it seemed more suitable to let the students select their creature. There are so many junior books with pictures of animals, for example, elephants, budgies etcetera. So we had a variety of animals from turtles owls, penguins, to bats and cats. The model of the owl done by a six-year-old child is amazing. I then took a photo of each model with the digital camera and am about to place it on an assessment sheet for their portfolios.</p> 

<p><b>Audrie:</b> 
<br>
Fabulous idea to take photos and then use them for the profile books. Will you annotate the photo, or will the kids annotate them, or will there be a progression of work shown &#8211; or none of the above?</p> 
 
<p><b>Chris:</b> 
<br>
We will annotate the samples. We are using them as an assessment and the annotation doubles as a report on achievement to parents.</p> 

<p><b>Christine:</b> 
<br>
Yes I will annotate them. I will write a comment against the learning objectives. I had not thought of asking the children to comment.</p> 

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b> 
<br>
Good to hear of the digital recording of work for sharing with parents. Ways of reporting is an area we will have to consider as the new curriculum evolves.</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b> 
<br>
The observational drawings in preparation for clay work are to discover information necessary for the 3D task. They are there to make the children look more closely. What is the sculpture to be about?</p>

<p><b>Audrie:</b> 
<br>
We are working on a mountain theme and looking to use sculpture to make a representation of our landscape. How would the idea of space and no "negative spaces" be talked about with the kids in this context? I have been for the first time browsing through the <i>Exploring the Visual Arts</i> booklets from the MoE and have come across these ideas.</p> 

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b> 
<br>
The presence of a recognisable object or shape is the positive, and the gaps between are the negatives. We must have a definition in the glossary. It is a very valuable way of learning to consider the whole artwork (picture plane.) To get a dialogue going in terms of balancing the negative and positive space assists with improving awareness of the importance of thinking about composition. I am delighted to see you want to deal with these concepts. When tackling a space and landscape exercise with students, look at the level 2 exemplars <i>Foreground and Background,</i> and <i>A Strip of Aotearoa.</i> The latter uses overlapping of mountains etcetera and the former tries to use change of scale.</p>



<p><b>Audrie:</b> 
<br>
The exemplar looks excellent. This will be a good focus for us to plan from. As usual I find the children usually have a better sense of some of these things than I do and it's great to be able to develop ideas from their discussion. Yes, positive and negative space is in the glossary.</p> 

<p><b>Lynette:</b> 
<br>
Should we have the Arts Exemplars somewhere, or do we have to approach someone to get them?</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b> 
<br>
The exemplars they are online on TKI under Assessment. There are five for the visual arts and there are a number for the other arts disciplines and for other curriculum areas. They are there on trial for comment. The URL is <a href="http://www.tki.org.elf.internal.cwa.co.nz/r/assessment/exemplars/arts/visarts/index_e.php">http://www.tki.org.nz/r/assessment/exemplars/arts/visarts/index_e.php</a>
<br>
The clay one is:

<p><b>Chris:</b> 
<br>
If a URL link is posted in the forum, it can be visited by "right-clicking" the mouse and choosing "Open in new window" from the menu. That way you won't lose the forum page and can browse with more than one window.</p> 

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b> 
<br>
We thought we would do a drawing exemplar that crosses several levels so teachers can see how children can grow in their ability to see and record. Does this seem a useful exercise to you?</p> 

<p><b>Audrie:</b> 
<br>
The idea of having a range of levels is a great one. My kids have been doing some work on drawing with my release teacher and I am really interested to see their work, especially as I haven't seen the processes they've worked through and just look at the end result. In my class of 26 year 4&#8211;6 students, there is a really big range of work being produced and I'm sure that a variety of levels are present. Exemplars showing the ability to see and record at different levels would be really helpful for us.</p> 

<p><b>Lynette:</b> 
<br>
A great idea &#8211; something on drawing through the levels. When looking to do a unit on drawing there is little easily accessible information. A guide as to the best way to progress would be useful. I found a small section in the painting book and a series of lessons in an old book that really were not gripping. Children spend a lot of their own time drawing and I wanted a way to push them to explore their own boundaries and go beyond. This is when I realised my boundaries!</p>  

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b> 
<br>
Well folks, its time to wrap up again. Thanks to everyone for sharing your comments, suggestions and ideas and tips. It was a really useful session. I look forward to your input again next week when Tina Hong will be with us to talk about Dance.</p>
