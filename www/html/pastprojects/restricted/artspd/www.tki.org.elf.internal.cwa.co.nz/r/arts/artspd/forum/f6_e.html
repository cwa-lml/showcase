<h2 class="h2-forum">Practical ways of developing lessons from the <i>Starters and Strategies</i> music page</h2>

<p><a href="index_e.html">Back to Archived Forum Discussion index</a></p>

<p>Excerpts from forum discussion with Merryn Dunmill (National Coordinator &#8211; Music)<br>
24 October 2001</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie: </b><br>
Merryn Dunmill (National Coordinator for the Arts &#8211; Music) is our guest on the forum on Wednesday 24 October.</p>

<p>The forum will focus on looking at practical ways of developing lessons from the <i>Starters and Strategies</i> music page. This is set around <i>Kiwi Kidsongs 10</i> (level 3 of the curriculum) and the National Anthem CD sent free to schools last year if you can locate it.</p> 

<p><b>Kerren: </b><br>
We have had a busy term 3 with ERO in the last week of school and now we are gearing up for a whole school production and prize giving on December 6 involving everyone! 
This is year 1 to year 13. Last year we did <i>The Biggest Little Kiwiana Show Ever</i> and our community loved it, so now we have written our own based around the theme of journeys. We are presently trying to find songs and music related to this theme. Your thoughts would be most welcome.</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b><br> 
Hi Kerren. Great to hear from you and to read about your wonderful success!  I can only think of song books that have wide varieties of topics and lots of world music (in case you want to travel around a bit) and that is the <i>Sing</i> series from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). There are some New Zealand publishers of note, no pun intended who would be worth pursuing too:<p> 

<p><ul>
<li>Rosslyn-Keynote Music Ltd, email: <a href="mailto:keynote@clear.net.nz">keynote@clear.net.nz</a> (lots of song books and could recommend);</li> 
<li>Viscount Productions, email: <a href="mailto:daverne@ihug.co.nz">daverne@ihug.co.nz</a>;</li>
<li>and of course Learning Media have all the <i>Kiwi Kidsongs</i>, waiata resources and more: <a href="mailto:orders@learningmedia.co.nz">orders@learningmedia.co.nz</a>.</li></ul></P>

<p>All the best with these. If you ask directly for journey songs they will be able to help.</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b><br>
I hope you all have questions/ideas about how you could use and develop this resource. I am turning it into another TKI learning example tomorrow and also getting some video footage of it being taught for exemplar purposes.  I'd appreciate your thoughts as well, like how to widen it out, narrow it down, what specific learning outcomes could you write from one or two of the teaching approaches?  How could you use it across other learning areas yet develop all the music skills and knowledge bases for level 3?</p>

<p><b>Virginia:</b><br> 
Can you tell me of some effective strategies for monitoring and assessing music lessons, for example, untuned percussion?  I find it tricky to try and involve, control, and make it a fun and enjoyable experience, all at the same time. I would really appreciate some advice or reference to assessment resources.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b><br> 
Managing practical sessions requires some thought indeed. If you have any questions relating to that ask away. I'll deal with the assessment and monitoring bit first.</p> 

<p>I tend to start with fun body percussion so that you can see what is happening and deal with things minus instruments, for example, take rhythms from a well known song, put them on different body parts in groups (tone, colour, effects) and perform with the song on backing track. Watch and observe who is coping. Have a range of rhythms from simple keeping-the-beat to harder patterns and shift the groups around so that they don't get bored. Ask questions after each group rotation as a formative assessment: 
which rhythm was difficult? Why? What instruments could we use to go with this pattern (for example, woodblocks)? What instruments with this pattern and why? How can we improve our performing?</p>
 
<p>Then move on to making up their own patterns without backing tracks using body percussion &#8211; maybe choreograph like Stomp group do for interest, around a theme like cooking up a feast in the kitchen (pots and pans etcetera). Learning outcomes should be established around:<br> 
<ol>
<li>Using suitable playing techniques with percussion instruments &#8211; how well do the students use and respect the instruments?</li><br><br>
<li>Playing in time with the beat &#8211; can they maintain the beat?</li><br><br>
<li>Imitating musical patterns (rhythmic and melodic) &#8211; how well can the children playback or echo patterns heard or peformed by others. This can be a good pair activity in the form of question and answer (improvising musical patterns over a beat).</li><br><br> 
<li>Reading and playing music notations (graphic for young ones and conventional for older) &#8211; how well are they interpreting the symbols?</li><br><br>
</ol></P>

<p>Do the children have regular opportunities to play the instruments and are there clear rules, for example, distribute and pack up?</p> 

<p>Also, when you assess summatively you can establish class criteria together, for example, "I can play the beat in time &#8211; never, sometimes, always." "To improve I need to ...."</p>

<p>If you use some of the above learning outcomes and develop them to suit specifically what you do they should serve as your assessment regime. Using formative questioning and a summative activity that focuses on one special learning outcome is enough. Individually you could get them to play back a well known tune by ear if on tuned instruments, or a rhythmic pattern on untuned and use your own criteria, for example (1) developing, (2) playing with some confidence, (3) playing confidently and competently, (4) for reporting to parents, etcetera. Keep it simple and it guides the learning and keeps the kids focused. Good luck!</p>

<p><b>Sue Cheesman:</b><br> 
In <i>Starters and Strategies</i> you mention this web site <a href="http://www.contemplator.com/folk.html">www.contemplator.com/folk.html</a> and I wondered if you could expand on what this website contains and how it relates to your ideas on music and getting started?</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill: </b><br>
The site is worth a look as it has lots of folk songs from around the world to listen to and reference, and hooks onto other sites for info. Have a look everyone!</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Bridget:</b> <br> 
Merryn, I'm very music-illiterate and tend to improvise when it comes to music &#8211; our school has many wonderful musical instruments including an electric keyboard, guitars, flutes &#8211; which have yet to be utilised. 
I have four boys: 6yrs, 9yrs and two 11yrs, and three girls: 5yrs and two 7yrs. One 7yr old tends to carry the school during waiata and when we have visitors though all the children love to sing. How can their teacher provide quality music lessons?</p> 

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b><br> 
Kia ora Bridget.  For the teacher who has no real background in music training but a brilliant ear there is so much you can (and do) do. That's great and the kids are lucky because your enthusiasm and love for singing is clear.</p> 

<p>The <i>Starters and Strategies</i> resource picks up on what the ear hears strongly in the music &#8211; <i>Aotearoa</i> in a funky little rhythm which echoes. So there you have the first easy idea after listening. Ask the kids what they remember when the music stops after the first listen. You'll be amazed &#8211; they'll remember lots that you can then develop through more questioning. Try to play that <i>Aotearoa</i> rhythm as an ostinato (repeated throughout) rhythm like a backing track. Use different sound sources even stones and sticks from Papa Tuanuku sound wonderful if she is happy for you to use them! Then go to the song many more times learning the words. Why not take the song and do a te reo version about <i>Aotearoa</i> and put in your own chords and backing?</p> 

<p>The <i>National Anthem</i> has that cool haka middle section. Again the rhythmic drive is stunning and a re-enactment ideal. Take out some rhythms and use them as layers of rhythms for an original composition. Put words to them and perform adding shifts in dynamics (volume), some speed or tempo changes, and hey presto, you have dealt with lots of the elements of music talked about in the PK (Practical Knowledge) strand of the music curriculum. By composing and performing you are dealing with the DI and CI strands, and of course, talking about the music and it's purposes, variations, differences and similarities is the UC strand and vital to a good music programme. We want our kids being thinking listeners for the future audiences and we want them creating and making their own music to perform.</p>

<p><b>Bridget:</b> <br>
Incredible, I was just listening to <i>Aotearoa</i> (for the first time) when your response came up. Awesome! Yes, I'd just decided "Hey, I can do something with that!"  Thanks a lot for your assistance and sharing. You have one very happy chappy, I mean lady, here.</p> 

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b><br> 
I'd just like to say that this is fun and I really enjoy trying to help people online. Once we get the ideas shared around who knows how big this thing will get!? Got some good ideas ahead for us too, involving video footage of actual classroom practice for you to comment on and develop ideas from. Watch this space.</p>

<p><b>Virginia:</b><br> 
Thanks Merryn for your wonderful advice. Do you have a list of generic tips for taking music lessons that include any type of musical instruments?  I think that when we are unfamiliar ourselves with the instruments we tend to shy away from using them with our class. How can we overcome our reluctance?</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b><br>  
It's worth grouping the instruments into types and use them as stations where you rotate the class. Keep instruments in good condition and safe. Have a means of distributing and collecting. I like to use the music we've been using in the lesson or a favourite popular song with a good beat, for example, hiphop, pop songs. The class can play the beat as they walk to the storage space, carefully put the instrument down in its right place and boogie back to their seat or outside, etcetera. Have a monitor check the instruments in and out &#8211; call them a roadie or  music crew, give them a badge or something to make it link to the real world. People have jobs doing this kind of thing to care for and maintain equipment, set it up, pack it up, big job!</p> 

<p>Vary the use of instruments too so they don't get bored with the same old ones. Bring in a new special one where they have to guess what it is, what-it's-made-of type games. Little ones like it when you or another student hides and plays the instruments and they have to guess what it is made of and how you make the sound. On a more sophisticated level the same can happen, for example, as a bingo game with pictures of instruments to cover when they hear them.</p> 

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b><br> 
Ka kite.  Looks like we might have wound up for the evening so I'll sign off too. Just thought that I didn't mention the music handbooks which are due out next year (years 1&#8211;3 and years 4&#8211;6 so far). Years 7&#8211;10 and <i>Planning and Assessment Guidelines for Music</i> are to be developed during next year.
 
<p>Some of the assessment ideas I mentioned are included in these handbooks so look forward to more specific help in this regard as we progress with the whole implementation package. Lots of good things ahead, including summer.</p> 

<p>Ka kite ano,<br>
Arohanui,<br>
Merryn.</p>
