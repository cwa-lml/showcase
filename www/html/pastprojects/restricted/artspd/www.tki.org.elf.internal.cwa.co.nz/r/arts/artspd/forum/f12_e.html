<h2 class="h2-forum">Planning and where to start</h2>

<p><a href="index_e.html">Back to Archived Forum Discussion index</a></p>

<p>Excerpts from forum discussion with Ann Brodie (National Coordinator &#8211; The Visual Arts)<br>
22 May 2002</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b> 
<br>
Kia ora tatou and a warm welcome to another Visual Arts Forum. Our focus this week is on planning and where to start. Ann Brodie (National Coordinator &#8211; the Visual Arts) is our guest online. The forum is active from 4&#8211;5pm on Wednesday 22 May but you are welcome to post anytime before or during the session.</p>

<p>This is such a rich topic. There are so many levels of planning that is difficult to know where to start. What with strategic planning, unit planning, lesson planning, planning for assessment, planning what, where, when, who and how... it is almost overwhelming. Clark and Callow (1998) remind us "systematic planning, organisation and management of learning...is considered to be an essential aspect of effective and efficient teaching" (p.90). They also state "it is easier said than done." So, how do you suggest that we start?</p> 

<p><b>Hans:</b> 
<br>
My first thoughts are to take each art element (line, tone, colour etcetera) and plan around them in sequence, but that seems a bit boring. What do you suggest?</p> 

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b> 
<br>
There's no one approach, but there is a right attitude for sure. I would love to hear what others are saying and I would like to share that the facilitation teams are stressing that the Context is possibly the key to a rich basis for planning learning.</p>

<p><b>Phil:</b> 
<br>
There are several visual art unit planners on The Arts Online. They have a range of information potential, for example, levels, strands, achievement objectives and learning outcomes. In addition they have spaces to include materials, resources, glossary, lesson sequence, evaluation and assessment comments, too. One has also the essential skills undertaken and the topic, media and artist's model as well. Do you think it's important to have all of this information on a unit plan?</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b> 
<br>
Yes I do but before that, there is broader conceptual planning to be done. Often people consider the art form they want their children to experience and then they devise a context. Perhaps that is according to a theme currently being pursued by the school or syndicate. But whatever the richness of the context work-up, what the teachers do is the key, it seems, to rich learning.</p> 

<p><b>Robert:</b> 
<br>
In an art lesson, when I am teaching a class of kids, each one is an individual who has their own special needs and abilities. Should I change the way that I usually plan a lesson? Is that what is meant by the context? For me it raises questions like "why are we teaching in this way and what are we teaching for these kids? Is it helpful?"</p> 

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b> 
<br>
It is not recommended that you have a classroom full of students all studying different contexts and different art forms and genres. Sounds like nightmare time for all, with no time for team-teaching or no guided exploration &#8211; a lonely road. Allowing students to have individual responses to the devised resourced and planned programme is the type of approach I am accustomed to seeing and advising.</p> 

<p><b>Jean:</b> 
<br>
I am not an arts specialist and am finding it difficult to know where to start. Can you suggest where I can find resources to help me get started?</p>

<p><b>Val:</b> 
<br>
You could have a look at these URLs on Arts Online: </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="../word/visual_planner.doc">http://www.tki.org.nz/r/arts/artspd/word/visual_planner.doc</a><br><br>
</li>


<li><a href="../implementation/plans_e.html">http://www.tki.org.nz/r/arts/artspd/implementation/plans_e.php</a>
</li>
</ul>


<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b> 
<br>
I suggest you start with deciding which art forms you would like to cover and then consider the contexts you would use to make the learning vital and exciting. Regarding all those templates online: the beauty of the choice is that you can select one that is ok-ish and then alter it electronically if you wish to.</p> 

<p><b>Hans:</b> 
<br>
Can you enlarge on what you mean by 'context'. Is it that the "subject matter" or the surroundings of the classroom (or series of fieldtrip venues) maybe, will determine how I plan my programme?</p> 

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b> 
<br>
I refer to the Context strand and all it can include &#8211; the motivation really. That is, the subject, the historical and/or cultural details, the art form (PTG PR etcetera) and the genre (still-life, portrait etcetera). It is not a debate really. It is going back to the issue of motivation &#8211; that teacher task that is so vital to engage learners so they find the experience irresistible.</p> 

<p><b>Phil:</b> 
<br>
How do we make the lesson irresistible to students? I agree that's the key to great teaching.</p> 

<p><b>Hans:</b> 
<br>
I agree that motivation is so important in art, but in my planning, I always want to have art lessons that will excite my kids, but I also want to make sure that I cover a set of basics so they end the year with a core set of knowledge and skills. The curriculum statement is a bit general in this. What should I try to cover (in terms of planning for PK &#8211; Practical Knowledge) in, for example, my Year 8 class?</p> 

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b> 
<br>
I suggest at year 8 you are seeking to build on their knowledge and skills in using elements and principles. Whatever art-making you want them to engage in, they will revisit lots of Examples and Principles in new contexts and for different purposes. The DI strand is vital as are CI and UC, as they do gain better practical knowledge and make richer art objects. They just keep on being experienced so the nature of the context is the source of the excitement the children need and the teacher generates or dreams it up. Have you looked at the trial exemplars? There is a great context in the unit A Strip of Aotearoa.</p> 

<p><b>Val:</b> 
<br>
This is the reference from the National Exemplars Trial that Ann has referred to Strip of Aotearoa. Select: <a href="http://www.tki.org.elf.internal.cwa.co.nz/r/assessment/exemplars/arts/visarts/d_2a_e.html">http://www.tki.org.nz/r/assessment/exemplars/arts/visarts/d_2a_e.html</a></p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b> 
<br>
I guess the type of approach that seems the most limiting and potentially barren to us is to focus on only the PK strand. It is almost impossible to do this but one could stress it and assess it only. Whereas in association, DI must have happened to explain the second mark a child makes on a page beside the first one.</p> 

<p><b>Hans:</b> 
<br>
The exemplar page is fantastic &#8211; best PD help I've had for a while. Yes, fitting it all in is so tough and we have to plan for all the ELAs. It would be easy to wing it with art, but we shouldn't be short-changing our kids in their art learning. Sometimes I use cultural/historical 'contexts' from social studies as a common topic and plan it out from there? Is that OK?</p> 

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b> 
<br>
Yes, use any context you wish to. Use as many given-assistance ploys as possible. Share, cobble, and be <b>creative!</b> Visual arts learning can be so marvellous for humans, but there is that short-change danger unless one is resolute, economical and realistic.</p> 

<p><b>Christine:</b> 
<br>
I really enjoy teaching art and I believe that my class produces a lot of good art, but I find it difficult to find time for good planning when literacy and numeracy take precedence. What do you think the focus should be for junior children?</p> 

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b> 
<br>
For little ones, self and near are the important considerations. Regarding literacy and numeracy, I suggest you plan art experiences that augment these areas. Have them use prescribed numbers of components in their art works to encourage counting; use language (talking about art) and also base art works on words. Pattern principles and concepts of bigger/smaller etcetera are vivid in art works. Use those ideas and art will be happening and literacy and numeracy will also be consolidated.</p> 

<p><b>Christine:</b> 
<br>
Yes we do talk about our art works. We did the exemplar for level 1 using clay models. We talked a lot about what we were doing. Also we were building up vocabulary. I was impressed with the way they took on board words such as tone and texture. Now we use these words easily with our artwork.</p> 

<p><b>Val:</b> 
<br>
From what I understand, planning requires a solid understanding of the curriculum and its delivery for all students, as well as alternative routes to take students beyond that to more complex contexts. It would also seem that planning requires a solid understanding of what students will be learning, how they will measure that learning and how they can express their knowledge and understandings and much more. It's certainly a big topic, this one.</p> 

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b> 
<br>
Thank you all for your interesting contributions. I hope there has been some helpful information.</p>

<p><b>Val:</b> 
<br>
We have enjoyed this huge subject. There are lots more to say, but it will have to wait until next time. Take care everyone: plan, plan and plan. Then have lots of fun with your students and enjoy their creativity. Hope that you can join the Dance Celeb forum next week.</p>
