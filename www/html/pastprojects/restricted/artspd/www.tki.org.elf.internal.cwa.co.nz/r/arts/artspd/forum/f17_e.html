<p>Excerpts from forum discussion with Peter O'Connor (National Coordinator &#8211; Drama)<br>
20 March 2002</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b>
<br>
Welcome to another drama forum with Peter O'Connor, National Coordinator &#8211; Drama. The focus of this forum will be Drama Conventions. For background reading see:</p> 

<ol type="1">
<li><i>Drama in the Classroom: A resource for Teachers of Year 1&#8211;10,</i> pages 8&#8211;9.<br><br>

</ol>



<p><b>Hoana:</b>
<br>
We are a two-teacher school. We have done some awesome work with our students but look forward to getting lots of input from this group. We are really interested in building our teachers' and children's confidence in drama. We are 99% M&#257;ori with one Swiss boy. Where to begin?</p>

<p><b>Gay:</b>
<br>
We are an area school, Yrs 1&#8211;13, and in our area we have a majority of boys. My question is how to introduce boys to drama without using props?</p>

<p><b>Wendy:</b>
<br>
We're a small rural school with a 100% M&#257;ori roll. There are thirty children in the school, all bubbling with enthusiasm. Are there any drama resources that show how to use M&#257;ori legends?</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b>
<br>
Kia ora to Wendy, Gay and Hoana. There is a lovely drama written up in the last NZADIE magazine (NZADIE is the subject association for drama teachers) about using the <i>M&#257;ui and the Sun</i> story. NZADIE has a web link on the front of the Arts site on TKI.</p>

<p>Begin with their stories. Their lives are full of the things that dramas are made up of. Start small and tie it into other curriculum areas. Use the stories of your local area; the histories and stories of their whanau, of their hapu, of their town; the stories of the school you're teaching in. Don't get the kids to act the stories out &#8211; that's not drama. Use the conventions to build a way into working with the stories, not just retelling them.</p> 

<p>You need to do some reading and PD for yourself. Look at the video and booklet that the Ministry has sent to your school, as it's full of ideas about how and where to start.</p> 

<p>Working with boys: do dramas that have both high and low energy moments. The trick with boys is to slow the drama down so that some learning happens &#8211; not just some crazy running around a room.</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b> 
<br>
I have just looked up the NZADIE site on TKI for the reference you provided above. Are these the resources you are referring to? My search came up with the following information:</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><i>Ko M&#257;ui me te R&#257;</i> by June Melser, translated by Sonny Te Huia Wilson: A M&#257;ori version of the story of M&#257;ui's encounter with the sun, originally retold in English for the Ready to Read series as <i>M&#257;ui and the Sun.</i> Media: Book, 12p. Language: M&#257;ori; Published for: Department of Education; Series: He Purapura.<br><br>
</li>



<li><i>Ko M&#257;ui me te R&#257;</i> by June Melser: A readalong version, accompanied by original music, of the He Purapura title of the same name (item 04147). Media: Audio, 1 audio cassette (6 min.). Language: M&#257;ori: Published for: Department of Education: Series: He Purapura.<br><br>
</li>



<li>M&#257;ui and the Sun by June Melser; an audio cassette version of the story of the same name from Ready to Read (item 04027), accompanied by original music. Media: Audio, 1 audiocassette (6 min.). Published for: Department of Education Series: Ready to Read.</li>
</ol>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b>
<br>
They weren't the resources I was thinking about, but they sound great. On the front of The Arts community site on TKI, there is an URL for NZADIE. It's their magazine that has all sorts of ideas including the M&#257;ui and the Sun story.</p>

<p><b>Wayne:</b> 
<br>
I'm a drama teacher at a large intermediate. I have found by using the drama conventions, all students (boys, girls, reluctant learners, enthusiasts) join in and have a great time learning. For example, freeze frame images are great for getting the kids to illustrate parts of stories like <i>The Three Little Pigs</i> &#8211; but from the wolf's perspective. </p>

<p>While they are "frozen", it is easy to teach elements and techniques. (What is the wolf really like? What makes him act the way he does?). From there, "speaking thoughts aloud" can be used to hear all of the characters' views of the wolf: they can draw a "role- on-the-wall" to examine outer appearance and inner feelings etcetera.</p> 

<p>The thing is, one activity leads to another and they are all interesting, so all kids have a good time and learn at the same time. Just a tip: each activity, I think, has to be short: give them three minutes to work out their activity, then view and discuss.</p>

<p><b>Peter:</b>
<br>
Yes, you are so right. The key thing as a drama teacher, or a teacher who teaches drama, is to know as many conventions as you can, so that you can do different things for different effects.</p> 

<p>Sometimes you need a convention that gets kids moving and sometimes conventions that slow it all down. The other key thing is to make sure we're not doing the same thing with freeze frame every year, so that the kids get to progress in manipulating the convention to tell their story.</p>

<p>Like you, I tend to be pretty fast in my work. There is a time to be slow and deliberate but other times you just need to give some energy to the process.</p>

<p><b>Phil:</b> 
<br>
I'm really interested in Wayne's comments about short span activities and time for reflection. I would be interested in the kind of reflective questions that you use. Have you found that there are some "fail safe" questions that can positively help improve understanding about the work being done?</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Peter: </b>
<br>
The Unwrapping the Arts site is being refashioned and in it, there will be a whole section on reflective questions for each of the learning examples. I think it's the absolute key to good drama teaching, so I have put a whole section in there for teachers. The site goes live in about two weeks. Have a look at the hundreds of questions that are put up there.</p>

<p><b>Phil:</b>
<br>
Thanks for that Peter. I look forward to the material on reflective questioning coming online soon. I agree that it seems to be a very powerful medium to work with and I hope to develop this, this year.</p> 

<p><b>Wayne:</b>
<br>
Phil, regarding reflective questions: firstly, you need to have a focus for each freeze frame. For example, if you ask the kids to focus upon the technique of facial expression, the question you would ask the viewers would directly relate to that focus, such as, "Do the expressions shown on the faces reflect what is happening to the character? If not, what would you do to get your message across?"</p> 

<p>Generic questions need to be open ended, such as, "What do you think has happened just before this scene?" and " What do you think will happen next?" This then leads to the next activity. You can use other conventions at this time such as flash-forward/flashback.</p> 

<p><b>Sue Cheesman:</b> 
<br>
Previously we have had some discussion on teacher-in-role. I wonder if you could expand on role on the wall that Wayne has mentioned in the last post.</p> 

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b>
<br>
Role-on-the-wall is a nifty convention and you see it used well in the drama video. Basically it's about discovering the role by drawing an outline of it and then using words, shapes colours and sometimes pieces of found art to say what you know about the role. It's fun and is useful for preparing for a role or exploring a role in a text of any kind. Neeland's book <i>Structuring Drama</i> has this and dozens of other conventions you can use with your kids.</p>

<p><b>Wayne:</b>
<br>
Thanks for explaining role-on-the-wall. By drawing their character and writing their characteristics, kids are able to build a character.</p> 

<p>A good next step is hot seating: a child sits 'in role' in front of the others. They can ask the character any question they like to which a reply must be made. In this way the child in the hot seat is able to find out heaps of information about their character in a short period of time. This can then be physicalised using the techniques and elements.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Sue Cheesman:</b>
<br>
You have mentioned that you think it is good for teachers of drama to have as many conventions on board as possible. Can you suggest a few that would form the basis to build on? People have mentioned freeze-frame, teacher-in-role, role-on-the-wall: do these provide a solid foundation for working in drama?</p> 

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b>
<br>
The elements are the solid foundation for drama. Knowing how role, time, space, tension and focus are manipulated is what you need to know to teach drama. Again the video and booklet are quite good at explaining this.</p>

<p>If in Drama you only know how to use a few conventions, then it's a bit like a dance teacher who only does folk dancing. You're limited in what you can do with the kids, and what the kids can learn, in, and through, and about, when they do dance. It's the same with Drama. If you can only do role-on-the-wall and freeze frames, you're limited in what you can get kids to do, and what they can learn about.</p> 

<p>So the thing, I guess, is that teachers do have to know something about how drama functions &#8211; how the conventions work. The video helps with that. Neeland's book is the best text. It might sound hard but it isn't.</p>

<p><b>Sue Cheesman:</b>
<br>
Is this the text you are referring to? I have just copied it from the readings list in Drama on the site. Neelands, J. (2000). <i>Structuring Drama Work: A handbook of available forms in Theatre and Drama,</i> (2nd edition) Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. This is a great readable book. It has a very useful schema dividing conventions into functional areas.</p> 

<p>There are a series of Neeland's books but this is probably the most useful for working with teachers fresh to Drama. The new texts (2000) co-written with Judith Akroyd on teaching Shakespeare are also superb. Hodder and Stoughton Publications. </p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b>
<br>
Recently I have been visiting some of our Arts Online schools to identify the barriers they are experiencing with online professional development. These schools are in rural and isolated places. The first noticeable challenge is that many are unable to identify the <i>Drama in the Classroom</i> resource that has been sent to schools.</p> 

<p>A proportion of our forum participants may not have seen the useful resource you are referring to. (If you don't have the resource, I suggest you purchase one from Learning Media Limited, PO Box 3293, Wellington. Visit their website also:  <a href="http://www.learningmedia.co.nz/" target="_blank">www.learningmedia.co.nz</a>  <i>Drama in the Classroom (A Resource for Teachers of Year 1&#8211;10)</i> was published in 2001 for the Ministry of Education and sent to all schools.)</p> 

<p>Secondly, many of our teachers have mixed confidence levels when they have to teach drama. It would be useful if you could outline what is meant by conventions.</p> 

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b>
<br>
Thanks Sue, that's exactly the text.</p> 

<p>Val, conventions are defined in the curriculum glossary (on page 48). This is a really helpful resource too. It explores established ways of working in drama (for example hot seating, role-on-the-wall, freeze frames) or established practices in theatre, for example, soliloquy, aside etcetera.</p>

<p>As to the video, every school was supposed to receive a copy per school and or one video per five teachers. It's orange and arrived last year about this time.</p>

<p><b>Phil:</b>
<br>
I am also interested in peer reflection activities. I would like to set these questions before we start in the drama activity. Do you think that is the best way to approach this?</p>

<p><b>Wayne:</b>
<br>
Reflective questions are great to feed groups. One of the aspects we are teaching is how to be a critical audience. When you set questions beforehand, it can focus attention on what you want the kids to look at closely. However, do not bog them down with too many questions: you don't want to kill their enjoyment. At this stage we are teaching the kids a new vocabulary, as well, and they must have time to assimilate it.</p>

<p><b>Chris:</b>
<br>
I had a thought about the M&#257;ori question. It could be similar for any culture. 
What about dramatic reading, leading into dramatic retelling? The storyteller uses only voice and body movement to emphasise and give expression. In a sense, it is oratory at its best. Isn't this what drama is all about?</p> 

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b>
<br>
Agreed. You can work with M&#257;ori stories in much the same way as you can with any story. I'm no fan of retelling stories dramatically for the sake of retelling them: it doesn't strike me as very creative.</p>

<p>I'm more interested in getting under the story. Why was M&#257;ui so mischievous? What might he have done if the ropes failed? How did the sun feel about being trapped? Using drama to find out the answers to those questions seems more creative and in line with the curriculum than retelling it. What you were describing about the oratory etcetera is what drama is about, in terms of the PK strand but it's much richer than that, too.</p>

<p><b>Phil:</b>
<br>
When we refer to "process drama", described in the curriculum statement as "children building belief in roles and situations, exploring them together, negotiating, interpreting and reflecting on role and meaning", is that referring to the use of conventions?</p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b>
<br>
Agreed, Phil: it's about quality of questions, not quantity. In the curriculum (page 36) it says we do process drama and drama intended for audiences. You will use conventions in both kinds of drama. They are just used for different purposes.</p>

<p><b>Chris:</b>
<br>
Is process drama like a community of enquiry where participants explore an issue, or is it a dramatic "in role" sort of process &#8211; or does it involve both?</p> 

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b>
<br>
Because it's drama and it is in role, we do create a community of enquiry but we do so within the safety of roles.</p> 

<p>The function of the drama work is to explore and enquire into things, not to present to an audience. This has always been a function of drama within communities, as well as schools. It is, of course, also what kids do in imaginative play &#8211; create roles to test things out.</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b> 
<br>
Well folks, another lively and interesting session. Thank you to Peter for his helpful responses and to everyone else for their useful contributions to the debate.</p> 

<p>We hope that you can join us again next week when Catherine Gibbs (National Coordinator, Arts) will be our guest on line.</p>
