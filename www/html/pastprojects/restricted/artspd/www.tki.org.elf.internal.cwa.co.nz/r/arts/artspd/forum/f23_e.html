T&#275;nei e paopao ana &#275;nei p&#257;tene nei ko Rawiri Hindle Te Kaiwhakahaere &#257; <i>Motu o Te Marautanga Ng&#257; Toi
</i> e mihi atu nei. Ko au t&#275;tahi uri o Ng&#257;ti Kuri me Poho Tiare. <br>

.</i></p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b>
<br>
It would be really useful, at the start of this forum discussion, if you could summarise for us the differences between Music in the <i>Arts in the New Zealand Curriculum</i> statement and Music in the <i>Ng&#257; Toi
</i> statement. </p>

<p><b>Rawiri Hindle:</b>
<br>
Merryn, the National Coordinator for Music, would have a more in-depth knowledge of the Music in The Arts Curriculum. However, here goes for the P&#363;oro discipline in the <i>Marautanga Ng&#257; Toi</i>. The elements are comparable to the Arts document. The M&#257;ori document places emphasis on Te Reo in each of the disciplines, especially around specific language that the children will need to learn/know related to each of the disciplines. The whenu (strands) are as follows: t&#363;hura (explore); mahi (make/do); m&#333;hiotanga (knowing); and maioha (appreciation). You are able to make connections from this to the strands in the Arts document. Another important aspect about the <i>Ng&#257; Toi
</i> document is that it comes from a strong whakapapa and tikanga base and is not a direct translation from the English document. Ask Merryn her opinion because she has a good grip on what she sees as different. </p>

<p><b>Carol Langton:</b>
<br>
In <i>The Arts in the New Zealand Curriculum,</i> a culturally inclusive programme provides students with a safe environment in which to develop and express their identity, by encouraging positive attitudes towards cultural diversity. Also, it recognises the diversity of individual students within particular cultures. It goes on to state, "cultural practices are always changing and contemporary cultures are in a continual state of development" (p.104). Question: With the continually changing nature of cultural identity, how can teachers ensure that what they are teaching is relevant for the needs of students today?</p>


<p><b>Rawiri Toia:</b>
<br>
Hoki koe ki te t&#299;matanga k&#333;rero. We must maintain the tikanga of why we do things. From a M&#257;ori perspective we should not look to change or learn new processes first but instead, look to the beginning of who we are as M&#257;ori. In particular with puoro, the way nature has influenced M&#257;ori music. The musical instruments have a whakapapa that links back to the environment, so should our cultural identity.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b>
<br>
I have a couple of questions from teachers who are keen to participate today but have to attend meetings after school. I'll post their questions for you, as I'm sure that everyone will benefit from your responses.</p>

<p>Question 1: As a teacher of mainly M&#257;ori kids in a mainstream English medium class, should I be emphasising the connections between dance and drama, using examples such as kapa haka, or should I be trying to demonstrate the difference between dance and drama? 
</p>

<p><b>Rawiri Hindle:</b>
<br>
That was a big question. Kapa haka should support topics taught in the form of writing songs and music. It's use in dance and drama or <i>Ng&#257; Mahi a Te R&#275;hia</i> should look at the process of dance and drama to highlight the words of the topic, for example, waiata a ringa action song, haka or as a choreographed dramatisation.</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b>
<br>
Question 2: Am I right in thinking that in <i>Ng&#257; Toi
</i>, dance and drama are combined in one discipline? For the class that I'm teaching (92% M&#257;ori), should I be teaching the arts as three disciplines or four?</p>

<p><b>Rawiri Hindle: </b>
<br>
We must remember that <i>Ng&#257; Mahi a Te R&#275;hia</i> is not just dance and drama. It looks at the performing arts as a whole. You're able to teach three or four disciplines depending on the contexts that you're using and the Achievement Objectives you're looking at.</p>

<p><b>Chris:</b>
<br>
T&#275;n&#257; K&#333;urua ng&#257; Rangatira<br>
T&#275;n&#257; koutou hoki ki aku hoa i roto i t&#275;nei hui <br>
Ko taku p&#257;tai t&#275;nei, (i roto i te reo p&#257;keh&#257;)</p>

<p>
I have a limited ability to play guitar. I often get words to M&#257;ori songs but don't have the chords. I do use <i>Hei Whakakoakoa</i> a wonderful resource. Do you have any other suggestions?
</p>

<b><p>Rawiri Hindle:</b>
<br>
Pureingia tonu o three chords e hoa. Can't help as far as known resources go but as for playing the guitar, don't restrict yourself in thinking that you have to play guitar or (any other instrument for that matter) to get M&#257;ori waiata into your classroom. Explore acapella styles, low-tech instruments, and in particular kohatu (stones) to find the manawataki (beat) and tauira ungeri (rhythm patterns). </p>

<p><b>Christine:</b>
<br>
Yes that is fine Rawiri, if one can maintain a tune. I personally need to have the melody line so that I can keep in tune. I am willing to teach the song without accompaniment.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Val Duthie: </b>
<br>
Chris, you have won a CD-ROM for your school. You will have a copy of <i>Creative Explorer</i> CD-ROM in the post tomorrow for being the first school to post on the bi-lingual forum today. Congratulations. There is still one more CD-ROM to be won, so get posting folks.
</p>

<p><b>Keri Kaa:</b>
<br>
I have a set of three questions that I am often asked when visiting schools in the East Coast, so here are my questions: Question 1: He aha ng&#257; matea ako? What are the learning needs? Me p&#275;hea te tuhituhi? How do you write it up? Question 2: He aha ng&#257; tau&#257;rai ako? What are the learning barriers? Me p&#275;hea te tukituki? How do you write it up? Question 3: He aha ng&#257; putanga ako? What are the learning outcomes? Me p&#275;hea te tuhituhi? How do you write it up? </p>

<p><b>Rawiri Toia:</b>
<br>
T&#275;n&#257; koe me &#333;u mahi ki roto i ng&#257; kura. It's hard to put learning needs into one basket, ne! He rerek&#275; ng&#257; &#257;huatanga o te Tai R&#257;whiti ki te rohe o Poneke me ng&#257; Taone nunui. &#274;ngari, kei ng&#257; kura tonu te whakaritenga m&#333; t&#275;nei. E tika ana ka puawai tonu ng&#257; tauira ki roto i ng&#257; mahi o <i>Ng&#257; Toi</i>.</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b>
<br>
As the M&#257;ori Arts Adviser to this professional development programme, Keri is in the position to be "out there" helping teachers with their arts programmes in a really influential way.</p>

<p><b>Judy:</b>
<br>
I work with Auckland College of Education and visit lots of schools. I find as I work with M&#257;ori teachers that they treasure the value of playing by ear but they are keen to have the children learn to read music, too. How will the document support that balance?</p>

<p><b>Rawiri Toia:</b>
<br>
The document looks at providing a base for students. As you work through the levels (koeke), the Wh&#257;inga allow the growth and avenues to learn to read music.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Jean: </b>
<br>
I asked Merryn Dunmill a question on her music forum last week about putting music scores on walls, hanging as mobiles etcetera, so that children could interpret and play them. Merryn responded, "The reo/language of music is universal and a wonderful sight to behold in a room. Putting up the students' work on the walls is commonplace but not their actual music creative work (yes, the projects are there but that is literacy in context). So let's all do it and bring music alive, make it talk, sing, sound... and play away!"
 Is this a practice that you would encourage? Have you seen many teachers do this and how successful has it been? </p>

<p><b>Rawiri Hindle: </b>
<br>
I haven't seen this in the M&#257;ori immersion classroom much but I think it's a great idea!</p>

<p><b>Christine: </b>
<br>
My class loves singing simple waiata. I have a very limited number and need some ideas. I can read music and need to have music to help me sing the melody line, as I am not so good at remembering melodies. Can you please let me know of book of simple waiata with the melody and chords, so that I can teach my Year 1&#8211;3 class.
</p>

<b><p>Chris:</b>
<br>
E tautoko ana ahau Christine. Can anyone else suggest resources that have tapes and music with chords and melody? </p>

<p><b>Phil:</b>
<br>
Have you checked out these two sites on TKI? I'm sure that Rawiri will have other suggestions for you:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Presenting a Waiata or Haka <br>
In this level 3 learning example the students listen to, discuss and present a traditional waiata or haka, following the leader's cues and directions closely. Includes notes on elements and terms, traditions and styles, ideas for planning and assessment, sound makers, supporting links and references for teaching and learning. <br>
<a href="http://www.tki.org.elf.internal.cwa.co.nz/e/arts/music/music_L3/music_L3_A2_menu.php">http://www.tki.org.nz/e/arts/music/music_L3/music_L3_A2_menu.php</a><br><br>
</li> 

<li>Waiata M&#257;ori <br>
This site has pictures and explanations of waiata M&#257;ori, including audio and visual files of action songs, poi, titi torea and haka. It also contains lyrics and history for each category. <br>
<a href="http://waiata.maori.org.nz/" target="_blank">http://waiata.Maori.org.nz</a></li>
</ol>

<p><b>Christine:</b>
<br>
Thanks Phil, I have noted those two resources down.</p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<p><b>Rawiri Toia:</b> 
<br>
Most Colleges of Education have booklets and tapes.</p>

<p><b>Phil: </b>
<br>
The <i>Ng&#257; Toi
</i> statement is written fully in M&#257;ori. Will there be a translation or summary in English so that teachers like me, who don't speak M&#257;ori, can get a grasp of the concepts? </p>

<p><b>Rawiri Hindle:</b>
<br>
Sorry there is no translation and there will be no translation of the <i>Ng&#257; Toi
</i> curriculum. In short &#8211; The <i>Ng&#257; Toi
</i> curriculum is for Kura Kaupapa and M&#257;ori immersion education. That's not to stop teachers in general stream using it and access to it is depend on learning Te Reo me &#333;na Tikanga.</p>

<p><b>Brenda: </b>
<br>
Kia ora koutou, koinei taku k&#333;rero tuatahi m&#333; t&#275;nei t&#363;momo kaupapa e p&#257; ana ki <i>Ng&#257; Toi</i>. &#274;hara ko Brenda, ko Jojo k&#275; t&#275;nei. Just wanting to know how everyone is going in terms of what kind of resources there are to do with kapa haka. </p>
<p>
<b>Rawiri Hindle: </b>
<br>
There is a new <i>Mahi a Te R&#275;hia</i> resource coming out through Pou Taki K&#333;rero (Learning Media). So be on the look out for it. You may be able to go through TVNZ to look into the possibility of ordering specific videos from the national kapa haka festivals run every two years. Wonderful resources for viewing top level kapa haka.</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b> 
<br>The second CD-ROM goes to Christine. Congratulations as you are the second teacher to post on the forum today. A CD will be on its way to your school tomorrow.</p>

<p><b>Chris: </b>
<br>
Kia Ora ng&#257; Kaiwhakahaere, T&#275;n&#257; k&#333;rua m&#333; &#333; awhi ki a m&#257;tou. Ka kite an&#333;. N&#257; Kirihi.</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b>
<br>
Mihi atu ki a koutou m&#333; ng&#257; whakaaro pai rawa o <i>Ng&#257; Toi</i>. Nau mai haere mai ki te whakanui t&#275;nei kaupapa a te w&#257; e heke mai nei. Thank you both for answering all our questions so brilliantly and for helping us to understand <i>Ng&#257; Toi
</i> &#8211; Music a little better. <br>
We hope that you will join us on the forum again. Until next time ....</p>
