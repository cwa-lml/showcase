<p>Excerpts from forum discussion with Merryn Dunmill (National Co-ordinator Music)<br>
30 October 2002</p>

<p>
<b>Val Duthie:</b><br> 
Kia ora, welcome to Merryn's music forum. This week the focus is singing. We are using <i>Into Music 2: Classroom Music in Years 4&#8211;6</i> as our reference text this week (pages 21&#8211;34). We will be discussing singing: </p>
<ul>
<li>rhythmically</li> 
<li>with expression </li>
<li>in tune</li> 
<li>in harmony</li> 
<li>in a variety of styles</li> 
<li>rehearsing and performing songs for particular purposes </li>
<li>vocal warm-ups</li> 
<li>what to sing</li> 
<li>teaching approaches </li>
<li>extension ideas</li> 
<li>ideas for assessment, and</li> 
<li>reflective questions</li> 
</ul><br>

<p><i>How to let students hear themselves sing</i></p>

<p><b>Jocelyn:</b><br>
I have responsibility for music at our small school. I'm not trained in music so have to rely on the resources that we receive. I'd like you to know, that I've learnt a lot through following your discussions and through the resources that you discuss. I think the children in my class have also benefited by my working my way through your resources too. I'm looking ahead now to next year and beginning to plan for that. I've been having a look through the reflective questions that are on page 33 and starting from there. I don't think that we've been too good at the bullet point: <i>Have the children had an opportunity to hear themselves sing alone or in a small group?</i> We have been building up their confidence and working in larger groups mainly. How do you suggest I let them hear themselves sing? Are you talking about matching pitch or singing rounds for example? I need some ideas to help me.</p> 

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b><br>
Letting children hear themselves is so important as the inability to do this is the source of out-of-tuneness really. We have talked on earlier forums about techniques like putting one finger in one ear to focus on one's self while singing, of pitch matching with others in tune around you (i.e. put strong people on a part with others less confident), and of moving around walking the beat and singing to really feel the part on your own. Opportunities to sing in small groups, even pairs helps that ability to listen to yourself so sharing for example verses around the class is a good method. Recording these with a tape recorder and playing it back for the class/students to evaluate themselves, focusing on how in tune and in time they are is important too. Video recording rehearsals and evaluating is another method.  Having a smaller group sing a song while others listen and give feedback, 'competitive' singing (not who can sing louder) where the groups try to outdo each other based on the learning outcomes they know and understand they are working towards works well of course. Sometimes large group singing can be the hardest thing to do when you can't sing confidently in tune, etc. You get lost in the sound of others so the small group, where it isn't threatening, evaluation and recording are the best ideas.</p>

<p><i>How to help a student who can't sing in tune but has no hearing problems</i></p>

<p><b>Murray:</b><br>
I'm sure you have heard this a hundred times. But I really have a kid that just can't seem to sing in tune or in time. The nurse doesn't seem to think that there is anything wrong with his hearing. I think I've tried everything to help him, but you may have some suggestions that I haven't thought of. I'd really appreciate some help on this one. He is a year 4 student and doesn't seem to have difficulties with other things.</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b><br>
You really need to work with him one-to-one to isolate the problem. Have a keyboard with you, play a pitch that suits his voice range (might be the problem, or part of) and get him to sing it back, if he can't, try a range of different ones. If he still can't, get him to sing a note and find it on the piano. Ask him to change his note, do same...find it and match it. i.e., start matching pitch with him one way or another. Then move to 2 notes. If he follows the shape of the pitch change then all is well, e.g., if you go up and so does he, but misses the note. If he goes down then you will need to do lots of 'does the second sound go up or down' games. Eventually you can move to 3 then 4 then 5 pitches and get him to sing them back and even play them too, on the keyboard as he sings, so that there is something visual and tangible to support the learning (may help as he works in the abstract later). This will take time but will be rewarding. Finding where he is comfortable singing pitch-wise will come through in this. In time singing in tune will come as he learns to listen to himself and then to others. One thing at a time, work with him on echoing back first just the words in rhythm, then phrases of the tune... everybody should do this with any size group to learn a song. Then get him to lead you and go where he leads... exactly, mistakes and all. If it is all over the show, then sing it as it should be and ask if he notices any difference (this could be recorded to help the process).  All of this can be done with a choir, class, and group or with individuals of course.</p>

<p><i>How can we audition and keep all the students happy in a small school environment?</i></p>

<p><b>Bryce:</b><br>
We have a choir at the school. We have encouraged everyone who wants to, to join in, and on the whole, this has been good. We do spend a lot of time helping the 'less able' though and it seems to be frustrating some of the others. It's probably time for us to have a more specialised choir. I have been reluctant to audition as we are a smallish school and I didn't want some children to feel that they were special or different. Have you any advice here. How should we go about auditioning so that we keep everyone happily singing?</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b><br>
Those all-comers need to feel good about what they do and continuing this choir is critical. Staging concerts/events where they perform regularly so that they keep working to the learning outcomes helps of course and hearing recordings/viewing top choirs is motivating. The more able students who you feel may become restless do need extending. It's the same in sport, an 'A' team develops as performance improves. This can be motivating for those in the choir, something to aspire to... it can also demoralise I know. Handled positively the auditioned choir becomes a special group who should perform along with the bigger choir. Their work will involve more part singing and truly show off their talents. Joining the two for a range of songs in concert helps everyone to enjoy singing together again without stigma. I would audition for a small group to start with, and why not go for a genre that focuses on a different approach so nobody realises it is a 'special' group e.g. barbershop, jazz, choreographed choral group, etc. Starting small allows for real expertise to develop and the new focus/shift from the bigger choir will not take anything away from that group. More work for you, but increased opportunities for students and mana for the school!</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b><br>
Thinking about the small school scenario, if you want to stick with the all-comers choir you can help those who need more support by separating the parts off. Have the able ones on harmony parts, descants, plus some on the tune with the others. Rotate these students around the parts to keep them challenged but keep those who need to stick with the tune on the tune. Rehearse them in different rooms, even at different times to save frustration. Bring them together at the end of the time. Put choir leaders in charge of a part, again rotating this around stronger choir members. You can secretly 'audition' for these roles by moving around listening as they sing and hearing who is confident and strong.</p>

<p><i>How important are appropriate models for teaching singing and what are some extension games?</i></p>

<p><b>Phil:</b><br>
There are so many singers out there on the TV, in videos, etc. and our kids all seem to spend a lot of their time watching their favourite singers. I wonder how important 'appropriate' modelling is when teaching singing?</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b><br>
Students need to hear a range of vocal styles and sounds, from throat singing to African chanting, to Kapahaka, to Asian styles to... When they learn a song, the expressive use of their voices should match the style and intent of the music. As with dancing, the style has to suit the music. If they thought about that as an analogy, they would see/hear the difference in how they use their voices (which are instruments), e.g., ballet would seem strange with rap, hip-hop with classical, etc.  So the voice qualities should be in style. The usual problem is the shouting using their speaking voices. Warm ups, exercises in exploring sounds and range of voice are critical to get out of that. The other is sliding around notes as they hear pop singers do. Exercises that jump from one pitch to another (intervals) help, i.e., jumping straight to the required note, e.g., play a note on the piano, ask them to sing 5 notes higher, think about it in their heads, then fire! Try with sliding up, then without. Do the same with other intervals going up and down the scale. Recording them and playing it back, seeking improvements and evenness of tone across the class/group is important. No one singer should stand out, so that helps those Madonnas fit in too! Give them a solo spot if they're really good!!!</p>

<p><b>Phil:</b><br>
Can you suggest any extension games or specific exercises that I could use to achieve the suggestions you make in the passage below? <i>'Exercises that jump from one pitch to another (intervals) help, i.e. jumping straight to the required note, e.g. play a note on the piano, ask them to sing 5 notes higher, think about it in their heads, then fire!'</i></p>

<p><b>Merryn Dummill:</b><br>
Extension ideas: using the scale 1&#8211;8 on C. The following is great:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sing (and play if you like) 1, 1,2,1, 1,2,3,2,1, 1,2,3,4,3,2,1, etc.</li>
<li>Choose a number to sing silently in the head.</li>
<li>Then silent sing two numbers, and have the class sing in opposite directions.</li>
<li>Using these scale numbers, call a number combo starting on 1, e.g. 1,3,5. They sing back.</li>  
<li>Start with small range and expand, as they get good at it.</li>  
<li>Children can make up short challenges themselves, and do this in pairs or have a class competition.</li>  
<li>These can even form the basis of a composition!</li>  
<li>Try singing telephone numbers with 0 being a B flat and 9 being a C sharp up the octave (above 8).</li>  
<li>They can try to sing their telephone numbers for others to work out! This is hard but worth a try as they get more advanced. Consider well-known songs.</li>  
<li>Tell them the title, like Star Wars theme. Sing or play the first note, e.g. C and get them to sing the next note. </li> 
<li>Could make it an awards game. </li> 
<li>Try it in reverse... guess the song (no words of course).</li>
</ul>

<p><i>What should you aim to achieve with a year 5 class?</i></p>

<p><b>Jean:</b><br>
I'm taking a year 5 class for the first time next year. I'm also beginning to look ahead and plan for this. What should we be aiming to achieve for singing with this year group?</p> 

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b><br>
With this year group, you are aiming at the learning outcomes in <i>Into Music 2</i> as listed by Val at the start of the forum. Singing in tune and in time are always goals of course. Unison, to rounds, to part singing (two-part, even three-part would be good). A range of styles will help them to understand how to sing expressively, e.g., some pop, some from New Zealand and other countries, some old, some folk, some classical &#8211; whatever you have access to. Try to get some songs that are slower, some quicker, some in minor keys, some in major keys, some modal (e.g. blues, jazz). Through these songs, discuss their purpose and characteristics so that the <i>Understanding in Context</i> strand of the curriculum is covered. Perform them, do original versions of them with own words, or a new chorus even. Have little listening games based around a song. Once you have played it through and learned to sing it, you can have fun giving a few notes from a part of it, which they have to complete, e.g., start of a phrase they have to finish off singing. In other words, integrate all four strands as much as is practicable. Make it holistic and meaningful learning.</p>

<p><i>Could you comment on music that is just vibrations?</i></p>

<p><b>Louise:</b><br>
I heard recently on the news about music that has been composed but is FELT as vibrations rather than heard. Have you any comment on this?</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b><br>
Haven't heard about this. Fascinating! When I was teaching music in therapeutic situations way back, I worked with a profoundly deaf and disabled boy. We used a large amplifier and bass guitar for him to feel music. I put one of his hands on the guitar and the other on the amp. He was so thrilled as this was the first thing he had ever heard. We worked on playing high and low and helping him to use his voice &#8211; he couldn't speak either but could imitate sounds by the end of the sessions, starting to find intonation and use it to express himself. With more work, he could have been taught to speak through voice amplification, etc. Maybe drum and bass music is like this, because when it thumps out of those car stereos I damned if I can hear anything, but boy can I feel it!</p>

<p><i>It is important to sing with enthusiasm</i></p>

<p><b>Carol:</b><br>
One point I would like to make is about singing with enthusiasm. If teachers can transfer an enthusiasm and joy to their students while singing, and expect high standards, they will achieve results more easily... and the students will leap in.</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b><br>
Enthusiasm, ability to have some fun and take risks yourself is a great modelling for the kids. There are Ministry books on singing, some dated now, e.g. <i>Sing Out</i> and all the <i>Kiwi Kidsongs</i> but no texts per se on how to teach yourself to sing. Use the advice given earlier, or you can do it yourself of course, sitting at the piano or keyboard. And there are texts you can buy for adults on singing technique. Best of all, join a local choir and have some fun doing it!</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>How do you balance singing and discussion?</i></p>

<p><b>Hans:</b><br>
Singing is a very active activity. Should we be engaging children in discussion about singing more at years 5 and 6? I really mean a balance of singing and discussion.</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b><br>
I like to discuss the songs too. They are historical documents, expressions of culture time and place, etc., so it is important to understand texts and the infinitely human expressions of everything.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>How early should we teach about breathing and singing?</i></p>

<p><b>Carol:</b><br>
With my 'singer' hat on I want to ask about breathing. I know that it makes a huge amount of difference to my performance if I concentrate on breathing correctly while singing. My voice stays in tune more clearly and at the end of the night it still can be heard. How early should we teach our students about the partnership of breathing and singing?</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b><br>
Yes, it is so important! Those exercises where letting air out in little puffs very slowly build up the capacity to sustain and release breath in a controlled way, then with phrases. The trick is to let it out evenly on long phrases always with a bit left at the end so you don't pass out! Bugs me when you hear gasps taken mid word, mid phrase. The best choirs control their breathing together brilliantly. In Maori paatere and chants, the trick is not to hear anyone breathe as singers overlap so as not to break the continuity.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>How do you get students to express mood?</i></p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b><br>
How do encourage students to communicate or express the mood?</p> 

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b><br>
Body stance/posture, even movement, eye and facial expression, tone of voice, and energy all contribute to the interpretation of style and expressive qualities of the music. There is nothing worse than seeing people move totally falsely while they sing, or using a tone of voice that is unsuitable, e.g., cathedral choir sound to a rock song or waiata.</p>

<p>The voice has many sounds &#8211; head, chest, throat, nasal. The way the mouth is shaped, where and when the consonants are placed, the purity or not of vowels...all affect the expression. Listen critically.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>How did singers influence you?</i></p>

<p><b>Louise:</b><br>
I'm just wondering who your personal favourite singers were when you were at school? How did they influence you?</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b><br>
My favourites were many and varied. I loved everything we sang at school but mostly those with plenty of energy, and especially anything in parts. I loved to harmonise and as a teenager I harmonised with every pop and rock song I heard.</p>

<p>I believe there is nothing better than singing in a choir as it is such a unique and powerful form of human interaction &#8211; emotional, physical, intellectual, spiritual &#8211; and all at the same time, and in perfect tune and harmony!</p>
