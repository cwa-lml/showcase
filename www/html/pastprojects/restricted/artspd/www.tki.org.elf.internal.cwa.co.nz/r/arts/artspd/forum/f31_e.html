<h2 class="h2-forum">How to integrate the arts into classroom programmes?</h2>

<p><a href="index_e.html">Back to Archived Forum Discussion index</a></p>

<p>Excerpts from forum discussion with Janinka Greenwood (Christchurch College of Education) and Wayne Flanagan (drama teacher, Gisborne Intermediate School),<br>
24 July 2002</p>


<p><b>Val Duthie:</b><br>
Kia ora and welcome to our drama forum with guests online Janinka Greenwood (Christchurch College of Education) and Wayne Flanagan (drama teacher, Gisborne Intermediate School) who will be discussing the question, "How to integrate aesthetic education and the arts into the classroom?"</p>

      <p>Wayne recently attended a summer session at the McCallum Institute of 
        Theatre in Palm Desert, California. <a href="http://www.mccallumtheatre.com/home.asp" target="_blank">http://www.mccallumtheatre.com/home.asp</a></p>

<p>He and Janinka will be discussing the sessions Wayne attended which focused on:
<ul> 
<li>using art works (visual, drama, music and dance) to stimulate units of work;</li> 
<li>learning and creating before viewing the actual art work itself; and</li>
<li>multiple intelligences.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>The delegation that attended the summer session has returned with many exciting new strategies that they can share with us, so please join in the discussion. </p>

<p>Weekly challenge:<br> 
The challenge this week is to search the web for a user-friendly web site that demonstrates how to use Gardner's learning styles in the classroom. Share your findings with others by posting your web site selection on the forum. By doing this, you could win an arts resource for your school.</p>

<p><b>Wayne Flanagan:</b><br>
As an introduction, let me say that aesthetic education is a discovery-based study of a work of art in drama, music, dance or visual art. Sometimes, the work of art will be performed or presented by working artists: sometimes it may be anything someone considers to be a work of art &#8211; a child's toy, for example.</p> 

<p>A unit of work evolves around the artwork: students actively attempt to create a similar piece before they are allowed to view it. Thus, when they do view or hear it, they should be able to "attend" to the work. They retain "ownership" and interest because they know the inherent problems. By using the painting <i>Starry Night</i> for example, a unit could be created using dance for star movement patterns, drama for relationships in the cosmos, math skills, visual art, making models of the solar system, etcetera. You can see how all of the multiple intelligences can be incorporated within the unit so that all students may "attend".</p> 

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Sue C:</b><br>
A few musings from me: I think of aesthetic education as encompassing far more than artistic education: that is, most things can be looked at in terms of aesthetic education but artistic education is much more narrow.</p> 

<p>I am fascinated to hear what (in terms of the artwork you are looking at) are you dealing with in the inherent properties of the artwork? Are they copying to learn from that way of working? How strict is the copy? Is this used as a springboard for them to then experiment and produce their own interpretation of the artist's starting point?</p>

<p>In dance this is a way of working which seems very familiar and is based in the discipline itself, I think.</p> 

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b><br>
Janinka has just called to say that she is having technical problems and will be delayed in joining us. Janinka would like to respond to Sue. Janinka defines aesthetic education as more than artistic as it impacts on social awareness and on how we make sense of society. It also refers to how we respond with our feelings and not just our logic.</p>

<p><b>Janinka Greenwood:</b><br> 
Wayne, if you were planning a unit of work would you start with the theme first and then its possibilities, and only then find the specific curriculum links?</p>  

<p><b>Wayne Flanagan: </b><br>
When planning a unit, ask these questions of the artwork:<br>
Analyse: What elements are found in the work? How are these elements organised? What choices did the creators make?<br> 
Interpret: What does the work of art express? What does it mean to you? How is it related to other artworks?<br> 
This will focus them.</p> 

<p><b>Win:</b><br>
It mentioned in the Action Arts newsletter that Wayne and Janinka would be discussing "writing unit plans in any modality". I'm not too sure what that means, so could you explain or describe for me, and others, what a modality is, and how you write unit plans that way?</p> 

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Wayne Flanagan:</b><br> 
Modality refers to subject areas. Unit plans become thematic, based around a work of art and include the multiple intelligences. The McCallum Institute format is to:
<ol>
<li>Brainstorm the focus work.</li>
<li>Identify three key ideas from Step1 that may serve as focal points.</li> 
<li>Construct specific questions for each key idea.</li> 
<li>Define the "line of inquiry"(overall theme) taken from questions in step 3.</li> 
<li>Capture ideas for activities as they arise.</li></ol></p>

<p>Take for example a drama unit on Harry Potter.<br> 
Open journal: What is a wizard? What frightens us?<br> 
Line of inquiry: How might Harry Potter help us to discover who we are? <br>
Activities: Making wands (kinaesthetic); poems (linguistic); strategy games (logistics); maps (spatial); and songs (musical).<br>
Thus, the subject area you focus on is up to you.</p> 

<p><b>Win:</b><br>
Thanks for the explanation on modalities. I like the idea of working that way, that is, constructing specific questions for each key idea as it is developed. Did you do any work on "constructing appropriate questions?" We as teachers are not too good at that &#8211; and often neither are the students. Any suggestions?</p>

<p><b>Carol Langton:</b><br>
Wayne, your point 3 &#8211; "Construct specific questions for each key idea" &#8211; this is a very important part of the creative process yet one in which generalist teachers report a lack in confidence. To ask the right questions &#8211; ones that are open ended yet challenging enough to stimulate learning &#8211; is a vital aspect to teaching, not only in The Arts but also in all learning. Do you have suggestions for teachers who are searching for specific professional development in questioning in drama and/or The Arts?</p>

<p><b>Wayne Flanagan:</b><br>
There's a great book to check out called <i>Variations on a Blue Guitar</i> &#8211; Lincoln Institute Lectures on Aesthetic Education by Maxine Greene, published 2001. It directs you through the whole philosophy and includes "the open questions in classroom dialogues" on page 104. Also, the article we were given was called "The art of question" by Denis Palmer Wolf. Contact me for more details.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Phil:</b><br>
Is anyone using private journals as a way of getting students to record their arts knowledge/understanding? What is the difference between open journals and private journals?</p>

<p><b>Wayne Flanagan:</b><br>
An open journal is a class brainstorm on an A3 piece of paper, etcetera. A private journal is when you jot down your own reflections, emotional responses and personal reflections, not for public viewing. And private journals also developed students' ideas and vocabulary to use in class. And time for reflection is essential!</p>

<p><b>Janinka Greenwood:</b><br>
The open journal could also be a notice board or a computer &#8211; any way for students to post contributions to a discussion. The closed journal is an important way of acknowledging that how our students react to work in the arts, but not only in the arts, is vital and valuable.</p>

<p><b>Carol Langton:</b><br>
One of my passions in art education deals with motivation. I will be interested to read how you motivate the students to explore the artwork in a variety of ways before experiencing the motivational spin of the artwork itself. Have I got this right? </p>

<p><b>Wayne Flanagan:</b><br>
Motivation is the key. Aesthetic education is discovery &#8211; problem solving based. Students are working hands-on, thus you are able to incorporate the multiple intelligences: that is, those that need to move about can do so; those who need to draw can do so, etcetera. This motivates.</p> 

<p><b>Janinka Greenwood:</b><br> 
I hear the passion you bring back from the seminar, and I really agree with it. Moreover, I think Maxine Green is a wonderful arts teacher and inspirer. How compatible is our arts curriculum with the vision of the McCallum Institute? How would you set up a project within your school to incorporate this vision?</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Wayne Flanagan:</b><br> 
Our curriculum is compatible to the McCallum philosophy. Their idea is to have aesthetic education used school wide so that understanding and appreciation of art is a natural part of all curriculum areas and will in fact, aid in the teaching of all subjects. Because we have an arts document, we are ahead of most US states.</p>

<p><b>Carol Langton:</b><br>
Here are two websites about the multiple intelligences theory of Professor Howard Gardner.</p> 

<p>This one provides descriptions of the seven intelligences<br> 
<a href="http://www.swopnet.com/ed/TAG/7_Intelligences.html/" target="_blank">http://www.swopnet.com/ed/TAG/7_Intelligences.html/</a></p> 

<p>This one discusses the concepts of multiple intelligences, children, teachers and education.<br>
        <a href="http://www.nea.org/neatoday/9903/gardner.html" target="_blank">http://www.nea.org/neatoday/9903/gardner.html</a></p>

<p><b>Carol Langton:</b><br> 
I have just tried to connect to those web links that I put forward, but couldn't get through to the actual page I was viewing. Best to go through Google and ask for a "Howard Gardner" search. There are plenty of articles.</p> 

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b><br>
In an interview with Howard Gardner (see <a href="http://www.newhorizons.org/strategies/mi/durie_gardner.htm" target="_blank">http://www.newhorizons.org/strategies/mi/durie_gardner.htm</a>) Howard Gardner said:</p> 

<blockquote><p>"One positive message: Pay attention to the differences among kids and try to use that knowledge to personalize instruction and assessment.</p> 

<p>One negative message:<br> 
Do not label kids as "spatial, but not linguistic" or, for that matter, "linguistic, but not spatial." The intelligences are categories that help us to discover difference in forms of mental representation; they are not good characterizations of what people are (or are not) like."</p> </blockquote>

<p>Would you agree with these statements based on your work with the McCallum Institute to date?</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Carol Langton:</b><br>
Gardner believes that each individual has a different aptitude for problem solving. He looks for characteristics in the culture that encourage the development of this. This is what we, as teachers, need to do &#8211; look at characteristics within the drama lesson that can develop this. Ask, "What conditions within The Arts curriculum and teaching will foster multiple forms of literacy?"</p>

<p><b>Phil:</b><br> 
I found this web site for the weekly challenge.<br> 
<a href="http://www.education-world.com/a_curr/curr054.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.education-world.com/a_curr/curr054.shtml</a></p> 

<p>In <i>Variations on a Theme: How Teachers Interpret MI Theory</i> (Educational Leadership, September 1997), Linda Campbell describes five approaches to curriculum change:</p> 

<p>Lesson design. Some schools focus on lesson design. This might involve team teaching ("teachers focusing on their own intelligence strengths"), using all or several of the intelligences in their lessons, or asking student opinions about the best way to teach and learn certain topics.</p> 

<p>Interdisciplinary units. Secondary schools often include interdisciplinary units.</p> 

<p>Student projects. Students can learn to "initiate and manage complex projects" when they are creating student projects.</p> 

<p>Assessments. Assessments are devised which allow students to show what they have learned. Sometimes this takes the form of allowing each student to devise the way he or she will be assessed, while meeting the teacher's criteria for quality.</p> 

<p>Apprenticeships. Apprenticeships can allow students to "gain mastery of a valued skill gradually, with effort and discipline over time." Gardner feels that apprenticeships "... should take up about one-third of a student's schooling experience." </p>

<p>Would anyone like to comment on this?</p> 

<p><b>Carol Langton:</b><br>
Good website, Phil &#8211; thank you.</p> 

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b><br>
You mentioned how students workshopped prior to viewing or seeing artworks. What kind of workshopping did you do? What do you see as the benefits of doing this? How would you change your own practice after experiencing this way of working?</p>

<p><b>Wayne Flanagan:</b><br>
It has already changed my practice. For example, this week I noticed a child having difficulty writing definitions of drama so I asked him to draw his definition. He was inspired. His whole attitude changed and he began to attend to the work in progress.</p> 

<p><b>Sheree:</b><br> 
Workshops included all four areas of dance, drama, visual art, and music. Workshops included all of these, even when the focus work was just one of them. Workshops started off with whole class, then collaborative problem solving group work, and were all very safe but allowed people to extend themselves in whatever way they wanted.</p> 

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b><br>
Thank you to all today's participants. I feel that there is so much more to share about your trip that I would like to discuss a way in which we can continue this discussion. There are so many exciting possibilities from this discussion. We really appreciate your input today and thank you for sharing some of the wonderful strategies and experiences that you have had at the McCallum Institute. Go well everyone.</p> 

<p><b>Janinka Greenwood:</b><br> 
Bye everyone, and carry on the dreams and the work.</p>
