<h3>Online materials</h3>

<p><b>Ministry of Education</b></p>

<p><i>Unwrapping the arts &#8211; dance</i><br>
Website: <a href="http://www.tki.org.elf.internal.cwa.co.nz/e/arts/dance/dance_home.php">http://www.tki.org.nz/e/arts/dance/dance_home.php</a><br>
This website contains a selection of dance learning examples for levels 1 to 5 from <i>The Arts in the New Zealand Curriculum</i>. Teachers will find comments on planning and assessment, elements and terms, links and resources. This is a draft of the material, and teachers are invited to evaluate the material and return their feedback comments.</p>

<p><i>The dance exemplars and dance matrix (draft)</i><br>
Website: <a href="http://www.tki.org.elf.internal.cwa.co.nz/r/assessment/exemplars/arts/dance/">http://www.tki.org.nz/r/assessment/exemplars/arts/dance/</a><br>
The dance matrix sets out key aspects of dance learning progressions at five curriculum. The dance exemplars will show many, but not necessarily all, of these progressions.
Although the matrix is set out as a table, which may suggest a concept of linear progression, this meaning is not intended. In practice, learning in dance is spiral in nature, incorporating earlier stages and building on itself. The draft matrix is an indication of possible signposts in the dance-learning journey. Students will "travel" in many different ways. This matrix will continue to evolve over the course of the exemplar project and a final version, incorporating feedback, will be published with the national curriculum exemplars in 2003.</p>
