<p><b>Freeze Frame</b></p>

<p>It takes some skill to present an effective freeze frame and it is worth working with the children beforehand to assist them with this:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Freeze with energy" &#8211; means be very intentional with the shape, firm limbs, muscles slightly tensed, eyes still and looking with purpose, hold everything still.  The only movements that should be permitted are breathing and blinking.
<li>Tell the children that they may need to hold the position for some time so no standing on one foot or crouching uncomfortably.
<li>It can help if the teacher tells the children that by the time they have counted to 10 (or whatever length of time seems appropriate) the freeze should be complete. They will need more time to prepare the freeze frame.  The count down is in the final moments to the freeze.
<li>Encourage the children to make interesting shapes &#8211; select students who have produced good work to act as an example for the rest.
<li>When a group of children make shapes suggest they think about height, grouping, how they look at each other, where they lean and where their hands are pointing. 
</ul>
