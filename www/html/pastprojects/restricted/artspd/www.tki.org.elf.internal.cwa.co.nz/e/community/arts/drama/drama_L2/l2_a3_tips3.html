      <ul>
        <li> You do not need to be too technical, the children need to be able 
          to portray something through clear movement. Help them to work out what 
          is necessary and cut out all other movement. If you do go into anything 
          technical look at making: </li>
        <li> a clear focus </li>
        <li> not splitting the focus (having two or more things happening at the 
          same time and the audience doesn't know what to look at) </li>
        <li> facial expressions are important </li>
        <li> clear sight lines for anyone watching (i.e. if there is an "audience" 
          turn the action towards them). Some children can be inhibited when it 
          comes to movement &#8211; one way to work up to it is to allow students to 
          play in the realm of caricature and move towards more realistic roles.</li>
