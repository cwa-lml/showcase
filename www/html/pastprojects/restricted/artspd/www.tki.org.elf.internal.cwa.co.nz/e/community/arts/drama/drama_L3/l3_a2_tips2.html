      <p><b>The telephone conversation</b> could be in pairs &#8211; where both sides 
        of the conversation are heard or a one way conversation where the group 
        only hears one side. The latter leaves the way open for: 
<ul>
<li>Journal entries 
        of the other side 
<li>Improvisation of the other side 
<li>Teacher questioning 
        students about what they felt might have been said. Some warm up exercises 
        for this: 
<ul type="disc">
<li>One person repeats the same sentence using a variety of inflections 
       for example, "If you would just listen to what I have to say." This can be done 
        in pairs or each participant can speak in front of the whole group. A 
        lot can be learnt about how people say things and what "presses buttons" 
        for people. 
<li>In pairs, each person is given one sentence that they have 
        to repeat while the rest of the group watches on for example, "Please stay," "What 
        is there to stay for?"
</ul>
</ul>
