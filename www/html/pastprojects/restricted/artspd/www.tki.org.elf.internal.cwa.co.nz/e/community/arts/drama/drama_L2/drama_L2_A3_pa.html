            <p>PLANNING AND ASSESSMENT</p>
            </font> 
<p><b>Planning</b></p> 
            <p>This learning example will extend over a series of lessons, as 
              a unit. 
            <p>There will probably be three major parts: 
            <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Learning about what it is to be a community. 
                <p> 
              <li>Creating and <a href="http://www.tki.org.elf.internal.cwa.co.nz/e/community/arts/drama/drama_glossary.php#bui">building belief</a> in the community the class develops 
                in the drama. 
                <p> 
              <li>Exploring the way the community reacts to the problem. 
                <p> 
            </ul>
           
            <p>The three parts will interact and although the community will need 
              to be created early on, details can be added as the process progresses. 
            <p>A <a href="http://www.tki.org.elf.internal.cwa.co.nz/e/community/arts/drama/drama_glossary.php#pro">process drama</a> is a form of drama where the purpose is to participate 
              in the process of learning, rather than presenting it to an audience. 
              This learning example involves a sustained creation of a belief 
              in role on a big scale. The process will create a fictional world, 
              and the participants will be involved in taking on roles in that 
              time and place, with action being sustained through the <a href="http://www.tki.org.elf.internal.cwa.co.nz/e/community/arts/drama/drama_glossary.php#ten">tension</a> 
              of the problem and resolve the tension. 
            <p>It will be more meaningful if the students can draw on the material 
              they know from a social studies context so that the community is 
              authentically based and provides a firm basis for building belief. 
              This will draw on prior learning and will reinforce and extend learning 
              through drama. 
            <p>The <a href="http://www.tki.org.elf.internal.cwa.co.nz/e/community/arts/drama/drama_glossary.php#str">strategies</a> below relate to each of the three major parts: 
            <ul>
              <p> 
              <li>What is a community? 
                <p> 
   
              <li><a href="#build">Building the community</a> 
                <p> 
             
              <li><a href="#def">Defining the community problem</a> 
                <p> 
            </ul>
            <a name="what"></a> 
            <p><b>What is a community?</b> 
            <p>Establish through group discussion the features of community (with 
              reference to social studies). The features which are likely to be 
              important to the drama (and associated questions) could be: 
            <p> 
            <ul>
              <li>It is a shared <b>place</b> (Where is it?). 
                <p> 
              <li>It can have a <b>common language</b> (Which language?). 
                <p> 
              <li>People interact and have a sense of shared <b>purpose</b> (Why 
                do they?). 
                <p> 
              <li>The community has its own <b>identity</b> (What makes it different?). 
                <p> 
              <li>There are different <b>roles and responsibilities</b> within 
                the community (What are they?). 
                <p> 
            </ul>
            <p>The aim is to create in the drama a sense of togetherness, shared 
              belief, and order in the community, so that, in the drama, the problem 
              brings the students together in a shared sense of belonging and 
              ownership and motivates them to work together to find solutions.

              To Top</a>]</font> <a name="build"></a> 
            <p><b>Building the community</b> 
            <p>The aim of this part is to create the community in the students' 
              minds and in the classroom. Based on the work the students have 
              been doing, their knowledge might be organised in relation to the 
              following questions: 
            <p> 
            <ul>
              <li>Who was there? 
                <p> 
              <li>What did the place look like? 
                <p> 
              <li>What language was spoken? 
                <p> 
              <li>What work did people do? 
                <p> 
              <li>What was special about the people? 
                <p> 
              <li>Did they have any special costume, any sign that was common? 
                 <p> 
              <li>What was special about the place, the environment? 
 <p> 
              <li>Was it mountainous 
                or bush covered? 
 <p> 
              <li>What building materials did they use? 
 <p> 
              <li>What was 
                their staple diet? 
 <p> 
              <li>Where was their source of water? 

            </ul>
            <p>This could be done as a class or group discussion. This moves from 
              a factual base towards the fictional drama world. 
            <p><b>Activities</b> 
      
            <ul>
              <li><b><a href="http://www.tki.org.elf.internal.cwa.co.nz/e/community/arts/drama/drama_glossary.php#colm">Collective mapping</a> </b> 
                <p> 
                <ul>
                  <li>Working together with teacher guidance to create a bird's 
                    eye view of the community (including hills, mountains, rivers, 
                    paths, forests, lakes, buildings). This could be on paper, 
                    or 3D (clay, or sand on polythene). 
                    <p> 
                  <li>Students may create the inhabitants as puppets made out 
                    of wire, brown paper and newspaper. They may place them in 
                    the world observe the world and share their understanding 
                    as one of the characters they or others have developed. 
                    <p> 
                  <li>Once the map is partially drawn, the students might be asked, 
                    and decide on, the place where people gather to talk, or the 
                    forbidden area where people do not go. This builds belief 
                    in the community and gives it a history. Formal language might 
                    be used &#8211; "This is the place where..." 
                    <p> 
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <p> 
            <ul>
              Following this collective decision-making, they could choose a name 
              for the community. 
            </ul>
            <p> 
            <ul>
              <li><b>Recreate the map in the physical space of the classroom</b> 
                <p> 
                <ul>
                  <li>Make the river, draw the street names, use masking tape 
                    to show roads, use cardboard boxes or stackable wooden drama 
                    boxes to show houses, use symbols and coloured tape to represent 
                    important places, mark the common meeting place, or use old 
                    fabrics to create the place. Allow the students to create 
                    different levels by creating their own signs for example an 
                    old ladder covered with green fabric represents the bush outside 
                    the town. The room may be totally remodeled so it is important 
                    to provide plenty of resources and to be prepared for change. 
                    <p> 
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <p> 
            <ul>
              <li><b>Roles</b> 
                <p> In this community what were the roles people had? (leaders, 
                  workers, cooks, hunters, keepers of order, entertainers, young/old, 
                  tellers of stories, food-gatherers, protectors/ guards, lawmakers). 
                  What were the three major rules?
                <p> 
                <ul>
                  <li>An element of mystery may be introduced to foreshadow a 
                    problem and build tension for example: 
                    <p> 
                    <ul>
                      <li>Who were the ones who didn't fit in? 
                        <p> 
                      <li>Who were the ones who were different? 
                        <p> 
                      <li>Who were the ones who had broken the rules? 
                        <p> 
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              Students choose the role they want to play and build commitment 
              and belief by creating in their groups a chant and/ or movement, 
              to symbolise their group, their role, and their contribution to 
              the community. 
              <p> <b>Teacher in role </b>
              <p> Teacher takes role of one who needs to find out about the community. 
                The teacher's role might be the person who is gathering and recording 
                information about the community before the ancient traditions 
                are lost. The role could be of a visiting outsider, or the one 
                who brings news. This supplies the reason for the <a href="http://www.tki.org.elf.internal.cwa.co.nz/e/community/arts/drama/drama_glossary.php#tea">teacher in role</a> 
                to be seeking information and thus sustains belief. Possibilities 
                for the teacher in role to move story on: 
              <p> 
              <ul>
                <li>Circulate, observe, acknowledge, and comment on students in 
                  role groups. 
                  <p> 
                <li>In role as an outsider, listen to stories from each group 
                  to gather the collective history of the community. For example 
                  the story of a time they were brave, the story of a time they 
                  saved the community. 
                  <p> 
                <li>Convene a meeting or gathering to give each group the opportunity 
                  to introduce themselves by performing their chant, or talking 
                  about their role. 
                  <p> 
              </ul>
              <p>This heightens the importance of the situation and gives the 
                students reason to speak with integrity skill and the purpose 
                of impressing listeners. </p>
              <p>It is important to note that the teacher may adopt a lower status 
                in order to encourage student discovery.</p>
              <p> 
            </ul>

            <p><b>Defining the community problem</b> 
            <p>A community meeting is called. Teacher may now be in role as the 
              person who will present the problem (the bearer of bad news). It 
              is useful to adopt a role at this point that is distanced to some 
              degree from the problem and to be able to withhold or remain ignorant 
              of some details, yet give enough hint to encourage students to work 
              together on solving the issue. Problems may be: 
            <p> 
            <ul>
              <li>A threat from inside for example rumor, gossip, crime, challenge 
                to established authority. This brings about internal conflict 
                that calls for possible solutions. 
                <p> 
              <li>A threat from outside for examplemonster, dragon, conqueror, 
                invader. This brings about external conflict that calls for possible 
                solutions. 
                <p> 
              <li>A natural disaster for exampleplague, flood, earthquake. This 
                brings about conflict in the greater forces of nature that calls 
                for possible solutions. 
                <p> 
            </ul>
            <p>The problem is likely to have emerged from the detailed history 
              developed for the community and may have historical connections. 
            <p>Teacher in Role explains the problem. The group discusses the problem 
              and finds ways to address it. 
            <p>The shared understandings established up till now will be a basis 
              for working with authenticity and commitment. 
            <p>Some of the work on the problem and the solution will be done out 
              of role. Conventions for entering and leaving role need to be established. 
              These could include removing a scarf or hat which has acted as a 
              sign of role, gathering round in a different part of the room where 
              out-of-role discussion occurs or an out-of-role circle. Some <a href="http://www.tki.org.elf.internal.cwa.co.nz/e/community/arts/drama/drama_glossary.php#sce">scenes</a> 
              will be played in role. The drama will be slower, at this point, 
              to engage thinking with the issue. 
            <p>Consequences need to be explored and there should be no quick fixes. 
              The scenes in role might be at another time in the story, for example 
              if the community had to shift because of a natural disaster and 
              the people moved away, the <a href="http://www.tki.org.elf.internal.cwa.co.nz/e/community/arts/drama/drama_glossary.php#rolp">role play</a> might move forward in time 
              to remember the old place. 
            <p><b>Assessment</b>
            <p>Assessment activities could include: 
            <ul>
              <li> Students to discuss what they have learned about themselves 
                and othersout-of-role at the end of the experience. Teacher to 
                record their contribution with their name beside it. Take all 
                responses. </li>
              <li> Students to create a visual diary as a social text of the process 
                of their learning after the event. There may be three groups presenting 
                their work at an agreed time. </li>
              <li> Teacher to observe the students contributing to a mural and 
                commenting on their work as they develop it to explain their role 
                in the process drama. The mural may later be displayed in the 
                classroom but it will be the comments that form the basis of assessment. 
                The teacher may ask two simple questions such as "What was your 
                role in the process drama?" "What was our most important discovery 
                in the process drama?"</li>
            </ul>
