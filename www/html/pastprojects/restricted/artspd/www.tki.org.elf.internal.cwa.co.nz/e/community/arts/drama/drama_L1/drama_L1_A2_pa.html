<p>The person (<a href="http://www.tki.org.elf.internal.cwa.co.nz/e/community/arts/drama/drama_glossary.php#tea">teacher in role</a>) needs advice about a cage or food, 
                or taking care of a new pet. The pet shop experts may provide 
                advice or create the cage out of old cardboard boxes.</p>

<p>The person in <a href="http://www.tki.org.elf.internal.cwa.co.nz/e/community/arts/drama/drama_glossary.php#rol">role</a> wants advice about an unusual pet, for example: 
                crocodile, snake, axolotl.</p>

<p>The person in role has read about a pet show but has never been 
                and needs help to prepare a pet for a show. A group of last year's 
                winners might be able to help by showing what she will need to 
                do to get the pet ready.</p>

<p>The person needs advice about a pet that is sick. The veterinary 
                experts can assist making suggestions to help in writing out a 
                prescription or to create a useful list of ways to help the pet 
                get better. What happens when the pet comes back next week?</p>

            <p>The person has found a stray animal and doesn't know what to do. 
              Students may suggest an appropriate authority, such as the SPCA 
              and members of the class may be endowed with the role through a 
              badge. The phone book may be used to find out the number of the 
              SPCA and this may lead toan in-role conversation or visit.</p> 

<p>Although 
              a trip to the SPCA is a good idea sometimes it is more valuable 
              for students to be able to problem solve through an imagined visit. </p>
            <p>This learning example uses the convention "Teacher in Role". 
            <p>One strategy may follow a sequence such as this: 
            <ul>
              <li> The teacher will need to explain to the students that he/ she 
                will be taking a part in the story with them &#8211; that they will 
                be making the story together. Because this may be a somewhat unusual 
                way of working, it will need to be talked through first with the 
                students. They need encouragement to "suspend their disbelief". 
                Young students adopt this way of working very easily because it 
                is very close to "playing" and because they can enter into imaginative 
                thinking very readily. </li>
              <li>It may be helpful for the teacher to use a sign in this convention 
                &#8211; perhaps a scarf, a hat, a coat, a clipboard and to say to the 
                students that: </li>

                <blockquote>when the scarf is being worn, the teacher is in role 
                  in the drama and </blockquote>
              
              <blockquote>when the scarf is taken off, the teacher resumes the 
                usual classroom role. </blockquote>

              <li>Teachers will very probably find that it is still possible to 
                manage the class from within the role. The students' interest 
                is heightened when the teacher takes on another role. Their attention 
                can be more focused and they want the story to continue, so tend 
                to have high willingness to cooperate to sustain it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The teacher might introduce this learning example in this way: 
            <p><b>The introduction to role</b> 
            <ul>
              <li> Teacher tells the class that they will all be in the story 
                together, including the teacher, and tells class that they will 
                be people who are, in this case, very knowledgeable about pets 
                (experts) </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            <blockquote>Teacher says: 
              <p>"When I put this scarf on, (or when I'm on this seat) you'll 
                know that the story has started." 
              <p>Teacher continues: 
              <p>"I wonder if you can help me &#8211; I've got a problem with my pet." 
              <p>"I believe you people know a lot about pets, is that correct?"
            </blockquote>
            <ul>
              <li>This is an invitation for the students to come into the drama 
                in role themselves. The students are given a role and the style 
                of questioning encourages participation, it capitalises on students' 
                natural desire to help and helps them to feel empowered.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>The exploration of the problem</b> </p>
            <p> The teacher could outline the problem and open it to the students 
              for their responses </p>
            <p> Teacher: </p>
            <p>"I've got a dog and he keeps running away." </p>
            <p>"Has anyone ever had this happen?" </p>
            <p>"Have you got any ideas?"</p>
            <p> "Can you help?" </p>
            <p> This leaves space for students to draw on their own experiences 
              and creates a feeling of empathy. </p>
            <p> The teacher can use open-ended questions: </p>
            <p>"I've got this dog and he's _ _ _ _ _ _ _?" (leaving space for 
              students to provide possible problems they might know about) </p>
            <p> The teacher needs to be aware of slowing the process and encouraging 
              the students to supply as many ideas as possible before approaching 
              solutions, for example: </p>
            <p>"My dog keeps running away &#8211; why does he do it?"</p>
            <p> "How is my dog feeling, do you think? What could be wrong?"</p>
            <p> "How is my dog going to feel about a new kitten coming into the 
              house?" </p>
            <p> The teacher can feed in hints and encourage students to question 
              and leaving space for the students to offer suggestions about what 
              the dog is like, for example: </p>
            <p>"Yes, he has got big paws, you're right." </p>
            <p>In this way imaginative enrichment can occur. If specific students 
              appear to be off task or attention is wandering it may be useful 
              to request their assistance. Phrases like: "[student name] could 
              you show me what to do when" or "Are you with me?"</p>

            <p><b>Finding a solution </b></p>
            <p> Teacher in Role can draw together suggestions into a list of possible 
              solutions. Teacher could come out of role to discuss this (taking 
              off scarf or moving away from chair) </p>
            <p>From this point, the possibilities for extending the drama will, 
              to some extent, depend on what the students have come up with. </p>
            <p>The drama could conclude with a list of solutions: </p>
            <p>"Why didn't I think of that?" </p>
            <p>"I'm off home now &#8211; and I'm going to try that fencing idea &#8211; thanks 
              very much!" </p>
            <p>This can provide the point at which teacher resumes other classroom 
              work. </p>
            <p>Students should be allowed to derole through speaking to the teacher 
              as themselves or through a simple physical cue such as turning around 
              to become themselves once again. </p>
            <p>Small groups could <a href="http://www.tki.org.elf.internal.cwa.co.nz/e/community/arts/drama/drama_glossary.php#rolp">role play</a>, for example: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Building the run for the dog. The teacher can move around groups 
                and let them demonstrate and talk about the specific tasks they 
                are doing. In this exercise students could use their bodies to 
                represent important parts of the cage. </li>
              <li>Caring for the pet and preparing the pet for a show, for example: 
                washing, grooming, brushing, dipping, checking teeth and eyes, 
                weighing. </li>
            </ul>
            <p> The whole class could cooperatively make the fence, or the surroundings 
              for the dog, the things to chase, chew, or hide in, etc. </p>
            <p><b>Reflective questions
              </b></p>
            <p>During or after the teacher in role activity the teacher might 
              ask some or all of the following questions to assist students to 
              reflect on the work they have just completed.</p>
            <p><b>Out of role questions </b></p>
            <p>What sort of person do you think the pet owner is? <br>
              Do you think he's a nice person? <br>
              What did he say to make you think that? <br>
              How did he sit or stand to make you think that? <br>
              Do you think he should have a pet?<br>
              If you were his pet would you like him? <br>
              Are the people who he is talking to helping him very much? <br>
              What help have they given?<br>
              What should/ might they do next to help?<br>
              If there was someone who didn't want to help what sort of things 
              might they say or do? <br>
              What do you think might happen next to the pet? <br>
              What would you like to do next in the drama?</p>
            <p><b>In role questions </b></p>
            <p>I don't quite understand what you mean by holding him gently can 
              you show me?<br>
              I'm not very good at remembering can you show me how to do that 
              so I remember? <br>
              Are you very good at caring for pets? <br>
              How did you learn so much about caring for pets? <br>
              What are people who are good at looking after pets like as people?</p>

<p><b>Assessment</b></p>
            <p>Assessment activities could include: 
            <p> 
            <ul>
              <li>Students can show acceptance of role by answering or asking 
                in role as expert 
                <p> 
              <li>Teacher can observe how student participates in role play which 
                develops from the drama 
                <p> 
              <li>Teacher can observe how readily student accepted Teacher in 
                Role convention in discussions after, for example, about the sign for 
                role. 
                <p>
