      <p>Some conventions work well with exploring the tensions: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Chorus &#8211; a group of chanters, singers, or rappers portrays information 
          about the turmoil the character is experiencing. </li>
        <li> Consciences arguing &#8211; the devil/angel sides of the personality argue 
          about the predicament. They may stand behind the person &#8211; one on each 
          shoulder. </li>
        <li> Voices in the head &#8211; like voice-overs or asides. The rest of the 
          characters might move into freeze frame while the person in conflict 
          comes to the front and voices their inner turmoil. The teacher may also 
          freeze the action and come to the different students in role &#8211; tap them 
          on the shoulder and ask them to speak what is in their head. This can 
          sometimes tap into the experience in a way that might not come out if 
          the drama carries on.</li>
