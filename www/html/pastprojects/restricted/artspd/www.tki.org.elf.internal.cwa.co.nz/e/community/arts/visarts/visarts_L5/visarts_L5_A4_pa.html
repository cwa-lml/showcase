<a href="http://www.artlex.com/" target="_blank">http://www.artlex.com</a></p>



<h3>Possible starting points</h3>



<p>Introduce the unit by bringing in an example of a personal precious vessel (For example, a jewelery box) to class, and encouraging the students to create a story about it. They could then consider the relationships between objects/artworks and the stories that are associated with them. (Remember the Tinder Box and Pandora's Box and the stories that have grown around them.)</p>



<p>Introduce <a href="visarts_L5_A4_glos.html#wakahuia">wakahuia</a> as a traditional M&#257;ori taonga or artform.  Consider wakahuia and other ceremonial/ ornamental vessels that house precious objects from other cultures.</p> 



<p>Provide visual examples of a selection of traditional M&#257;ori art objects and forms such as ornaments, pendants, carving, kowhaiwhai patterns (slides and visual resources). Discuss their qualities and characteristics.</p>



<p>Students could visit a local site (or museum) to view examples of wakahuia and vessels from a variety of cultures recording information in drawings and notes.</p>



<p>Arrange for students to visit a local marae that features traditional design elements. Students could learn about the structure of the marae and investigate components, exploring carvings and other functional and decorative qualities through drawing and written investigations.</p>



<p>The teacher could provide visual examples of a range of vessels for a wall display, creating a focus on wakahuia in particular.</p>



<p align="right"><font face="Times New Roman maori, Times New Roman, Times, arial maori, arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#000000">[<a href="#top">Back To Top</a>]</font></p>





<h3>Possible learning approaches</h3>



<h4>Response to visual examples</h4>



<p>In discussion students could consider the different forms, functions and decorative features of a variety of vessels/containers from a range of different cultures and times. Use traditional and contemporary examples.</p>

 

<h3>Possible tasks and questions</h3>



<p>Describe the vessel or container, its appearance and general features.</p>

 

<p>Who made the vessel or container?</p> 



<p>What is or was the purpose or function of the vessel or container?</p>



<p>When was it made?</p>



<p>How was it valued and by whom?</p>



<p>How was it decorated?</p>



<h4>Focus on wakahuia</h4>



<p>Show students visual examples of the wakahuia. Have students investigate key aspects of traditional wakahuia.</p> 



<p>Possible questions could include:</p>



<ul>

<li>What does the M&#257;ori term wakahuia mean?</li>

<p>

<li>Who made wakahuia?</li>

<p>

<li>Who would own a wakahuia in traditional M&#257;ori society?</li>

<p>

<li>What were wakahuia used for?</li>

<p>

<li>What kinds of objects would be kept inside wakahuia?</li>

<p>

<li>How was the wakahuia decorated?</li>

</ul> 



<p>Students could also investigate the role of the master carver in both traditional and contemporary contexts. If possible, include a visit to a carver's workshop or marae in a local area.</p>



<h4>Teaching notes</h4>

 

<p>Wakahuia were small, ornate, carved wooden containers used to store personal valuables. Traditional M&#257;ori houses (whare), had neither cupboards nor drawers so containers were necessary. Wakahuia varied in size from 25 to 90 centimeters in length. They were usually decorated with carving patterns, tiki and manaia forms. The carving styles varied, being specific to particular tribal areas throughout New Zealand.</p> 



<p>The term wakahuia is a composite word: waka meaning canoe or vessel and huia referring to the huia bird. Huia feathers were highly valued possessions that were often stored inside. Other precious items that were stored included rare feathers, jade ornaments and combs.</p> 



<p>Wakahuia were usually owned by people of importance, such as those of chiefly status.</p> 



<p>They were carved in many shapes. Most symbolically resemble the shape of larger waka. </p>



<p>An inserted lid, sometimes fitted in particularly ingenious ways, was a single common feature.</p> 



<p>Wakahuia were designed so that cords could be attached to their projecting ends and passed through holes in the lid. They were suspended from rafters or walls in traditional whare (houses). Rafters were often in easy reach as traditional M&#257;ori whare were quite small in size.</p>



<p>Wakahuia were usually carved on all sides and at the ends. Some were more rectangular in shape while others had rounded oval lids. The most elaborate carving decoration usually appeared on the underside of the wakahuia as the boxes were mostly viewed from below. In addition, the lids were often elaborately decorated.</p>



<p>Some wakahuia represented a canoe hull form with tiki heads projecting out from each end, similar to the heads seen on the prows of certain canoes. The bodies of these heads were sometimes placed on the underside of the box.</p>



<p align="right"><font face="Times New Roman maori, Times New Roman, Times, arial maori, arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#000000">[<a href="#top">Back To Top</a>]</font></p>



<h4>The development of ideas for a personal wakahuia</h4>



<p>Students could begin by investigating traditional carving patterns, from different tribal areas. (Note that most traditional M&#257;ori carving patterns are formatted in rows). A variety of drawing media could be used, such as pencil, pastel, ink and dyes, for line drawings with tone added, to record this information. Photocopies and photographs could be used along with drawings and notes. An investigation of carved tiki and manaia forms used in traditional M&#257;ori art could also be included.</p>



<p>Students could investigate and research a variety of traditional and contemporary decorative patterns from other cultures and traditions. They could explore and collect patterns that come from their personal life or everyday environment. They could include photographs and drawings, with notes, describing the significance that these patterns have for them. Students could then select a motif and, using the information gathered, develop their own approach to pattern. They could explore the following:</p>



<ul>

<li>Change of scale (using the same motif or a combination of motifs in various sizes).</li>

<p>

<li>Repetition, exploring the effects of rotation, translation, horizontal and vertical reflection etc.</li>

<p>

<li>Overlapping (overlapping rows or bands of patterns in a composition).</li>

<p>

<li>Using a triangular format, or other shape, within which the pattern is contained.</li>

<p>

<li>Using a grid-based composition.</li>

<p>

<li>A combination of compositional approaches.</li>

</ul>

 

<p>Students should use these patterns to explore drawing and paint techniques using tone, line and colour.</p>



<p>These explorations could provide ideas for the decoration of the student's personal wakahuia and could also suggest its three-dimensional form.</p>



<h4>Investigating texture and surface</h4>



<p>Students could explore ways of creating textured surfaces upon which to create their selected pattern. Materials could include sand, sawdust, hessian, twine,  and a variety of papers such as tissue, wallpapers etc. Processes and techniques could include scumbling, glazing and collage.</p>   



<h4>Investigating shapes and symbols as found in contemporary art</h4>



<p>Students could investigate and discuss the use of shapes and symbols in examples of contemporary art from New Zealand and overseas. These could include two-and three-dimensional examples from M&#257;ori, European, Pacific Island and Asian traditions. Contemporary M&#257;ori artists could include Para Matchitt, Bob Jahnke, Sandy Adsett.</p>



<p>Students could discuss and describe how selected artists use shapes and symbols to communicate their ideas and consider ways of using this approach to inform the making of their personalized wakahuia.</p>



<p>Students could discuss which symbols and shapes they would select, giving reasons for their choices.  Selecting from these ideas, they could develop concept drawings for their own whakahuia, remembering to include a lid and decoration in their planning.</p>



<h4>Investigating construction materials</h4>

 

<p>Students could make small maquettes exploring different construction materials and techniques</p>



<h4>Students complete a final wakahuia</h4>



<p>Students should select their best approach and create a final work. This might involve applying papier m&acirc;ch&eacute; to an armature, (underlying framework), collaging the textured effect, created earlier, to appropriate surfaces, and applying the painted design they developed, to selected parts of the vessel.</p>



 

<h4>Display</h4>

 

<p>The wakahuia could be displayed collectively on a wall, or suspended from a ceiling or a frame. It is suggested that they should be suspended on relatively long strings or cords to allow viewers to see the lids and all decorative components.</p>

<h3>Materials</h3>



<p>Drawing and paint media<br>

A variety of materials for creating texture (sand, sawdust etc)<br>

Construction materials: chicken wire, card, bamboo, lacing wire, string

<br>

Papers, including tissue<br>

Paste for papier m&acirc;ch&eacute;<br>

Equipment: wire cutters, craft knives, rulers, handsaws, glue guns,  string, staple guns etc.</p>





<h3>Assessment</h3> 



<p>Possible specific learning outcomes include:</p>



<p>Students will be able to:</p> 





<ul>

<li>Generate, develop and refine ideas based on their study of wakahuia, patterns, symbols and selected artists' works, in order to create a personal wakahuia (DI) .</li>

<p>

<li>Investigate the relationship between the production of traditional and contemporary containers and their social context (UC) .</li>

<p>

<li>Use a variety of techniques and processes with media to create a three-dimensional wakahuia (PK) .</li>

</ul>
