      <p><b>Time </b></p>
      <p>You may need to relate this to something the students can relate to "This 
        would take place long after you have normally gone to bed." "This happened 
        when your father was a tiny boy." For older students a date or time could 
        be written on the board or a clock could be brought in with a different 
        time on it. </p>
      <p><b>Space</b></p>
      <p>Rearranging the furniture is a simple first step to alter the space &#8211; 
        ask the students for their ideas on what to use and how to place them. 
        The addition of simple props and fabrics can dramatically alter a space.
