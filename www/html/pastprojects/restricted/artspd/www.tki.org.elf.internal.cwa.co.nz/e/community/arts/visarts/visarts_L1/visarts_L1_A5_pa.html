<h1>Level 1: Self Portraiture </h1> 

<p>

<h2>PLANNING AND ASSESSMENT</h2>



<p>



The following <a href="visarts_L1_A5_glos.html#elements">elements</a> and <a href="visarts_L1_A5_glos.html#prin">principles</a> will be the focus for discussion in this learning example.

<p>

<h3>Elements</h3>

<ul>

<li>Line &#8211; Consider how line has been used for outline, emphasis or detail e.g., <a href="visarts_L1_A5_glos.html#hatch">hatching</a>, dotting, outline, pattern. Is it controlled, spontaneous?



<li>Space &#8211; Consider whether the artworks have a flat two-dimensional quality or sense of depth and form.  Look at the distance or area between shapes in an artwork e.g., in front, behind, beside, close/distant, background/foreground.



<li>Shape &#8211; Consider the different shapes that are used in a picture.  Do they relate to known geometric shapes? (circle, square, rectangle, triangle).

</ul>

<p>



<h3>Principles</h3>

<p>

<a href="visarts_L1_A5_glos.html#comp">Composition</a>  &#8211; Consider how the lines, shapes and colours are arranged within an artwork (e.g., unity, balance, rhythm).

<p>

Balance &#8211; How is the artwork composed (e.g., symmetrical/asymmetrical, formal/informal).

<p>

Contrast &#8211; Examine the effects when opposite qualities are used (e.g., light/dark tones, warm/cold colours, large/small shapes).

<p>

<p>

<b>Note: </b>Elements and principles should be introduced gradually over several lessons.

<p>



<h4>Possible starting points</h4>

<p>

<i>Focusing on the topic</i>

<p>

Discuss with the students that a portrait is a picture of a person.  In the days before photography a painted portrait was the only way to record a true likeness of people.  Some portraits were of family groups and often included the pets and some were of just one person.  Many artists made a good living painting portraits.  C. F. Goldie, Holbein, Rembrandt and Van Gogh, all painted many portraits.

<p>

Sometimes artists paint pictures of themselves.  These are called self-portraits.  Artists would sometimes paint themselves in large groups of people maybe as a joke or maybe to remind viewers of who created the work.  Van Gogh painted many self-portraits.  Portraits by artists are still made today and modern artists like to make self-portraits too.  You may like to look at Shona McFarlane's self-portrait in her book White Moas and Artichokes.

<p>

Gather a variety of portraits from a number of artists, i.e., C. F. Goldie (New Zealand), Van Gogh, Rembrandt, etc for the students to view.

<p>

If possible have a variety of these artists' portraits available to use within the classroom for all lessons.

<p>

<b>At this point it would be a good idea to photograph each student individually for the following activities.  You will be photographing just the head and shoulders of each student.</b>

<p>



<i>Discussion</i>

<p>

Discuss the portraits:

<p>

Is it a self-portrait?<br>



How has the artist used the space to create the portrait? (i.e., is the entire body depicted or is it just head and shoulders?)  <br>

<i>Find two examples of heads and shoulders as well as full body for discussion of difference</i><br>



What facial features can we see? (i.e., freckles, glasses etc). Feel own face.<br>



What type of hair does the person have?<br>



What other features can we see? i.e., jewellery, moustache, moko etc<br>



What clues can the children see that tell them something about the person?<br>



How has the artist used the space?  What is behind, beside and in front of the person's face?<br>



What colours do you see in the picture?<br>



How old do you think the person is?<br>



What do you think this person does?<br>

<br>

<h4>Possible learning approaches</h4> <a href="#note">(see note)</a>

<p>

Each activity could be the focus for one or more lessons or a unit of work.

<p>

The following are ideas which the teacher can select, adapt and apply by using instructions appropriate to the level of the students.

<p>



<i>Starter</i>

<p>

Without any discussion ask the students to draw a face on a piece of rope brown paper the approximate size of the students' head and shoulders.  Minimise discussion with the students, as this initial drawing will be compared with further portraits drawn by the students.

<p>

At this stage do not discuss the original drawing until the students have completed their second self-portrait.

<p>

For the next session have the students feel their own face.

<p>

Begin at the top and ask the studetns to describe what they feel.  (You may wish to use a class member for the basis of this discussion)

<ul>

<li>Where does your hair finish on your face?

<li>What is the next thing you feel?

<li>Can you feel your eyes next?

<li>Can you feel your cheekbones?

<li>Run your fingers along them

<li>How far down the face do the eyes come?

<li>Where are the tops of the ears?

<li>Where is your nose?

<li>What shape does it feel like?

<li>Does it feel big or small?

<li>Run your fingers straight underneath your nose, what do you feel now?

<li>Are your lips open or closed?

<li>Can you feel a little dent on your face before you get to your chin?

<li>Where does your body go after you have felt your chin?  Discuss how your face now develops, goes into your neck

</ul>

<p>

After this discussion, have the students draw a self-portrait on another piece of rope brown paper.  Remind the students about the points discussed as a class.  This will help the students to think about their facial features and their placement.  Discuss the second self-portrait as a class.  Look at the initial drawing and compare the two.  Discuss what differences they can see.

<p>

<b><a name="note">Note</a><br>



Provide a range of chalk pieces, i.e., fat and thin pieces, to enable the students to get a greater range of tonal qualities within their drawings.  If there is a range of chalk for the students to work with the experience will be more exciting.

<p>

Encourage the students to work confidently with the chalk to create a variety of thick and thin lines, heavy and light lines, dark and soft lines and to create patterns and textures.  The children may need to be shown how to turn the chalk on its side, or use its point for a different texture/contrast.  (Refer page 58</b> <a href="visarts_L1_A5_tm_e.html"><i>Over the Rainbow</i></a> <b>Phillipa Stitchbury-Cooper for drawing techniques that may be used.)</b>

<p>



Provide a mirror for each student, ask them to look at themselves revisiting previous discussion points.  Get the students to look at the size of the paper and talk about how their face and neck will need to fill this page.  Get them to draw with their finger the outline of their face on the page.  With a piece of chalk have them draw the outline of their face, and continue with their self-portrait.  Keep referring students to discussion points and encourage them to continue looking in the mirror.

<p>

After the students' third drawing revisit the self-portrait discussion points and discuss the following:

<ul>



<li>Do the drawings look like real faces?

<li>What did you do differently after you had felt your face?

<li>What did you do differently after you had both felt and studied your face?

<li>Do you think your self-portrait looks like you?

<li>Do you want to add anything?

<li>Are you pleased or would you like to create another self-portrait?



</ul>

<p>

Place the three/four drawings that the students have created in order, from the first drawing to their last one.  Look at the progress made and discuss this.

<p>

<b>These activities can be developed further using pastel, painting, crayon, sand, batik etc as the medium for further work.</b>

<p>



<h4>Handy hints</h4>

<p>

The children would benefit from exploring drawing techniques (Refer p. 58 <a href="visarts_L1_A5_tm_e.html"><i>Over the Rainbow</i></a> Phillippa Stichbury-Cooper for drawing techniques that could be used).

<p>



<h4>Materials</h4>

<p>

Sugar paper/rope brown paper, approximately the size of students' head for all three drawings.

Variety of chalk pieces for students to use.

<p>



<h4>Assessment</h4>

<p>

Possible learning outcomes:

<p>

The students will be able to:

<ul>

<li>explore ways of using the space around their portrait (PK);



<li>begin to use drawing tools and techniques within their work (PK/DI);



<li>explore the principles of balance and contrast in their own work and recognise them in others' work (PK/CI);



<li>talk about the purposes of different sorts of portraits (UC).



</ul>
