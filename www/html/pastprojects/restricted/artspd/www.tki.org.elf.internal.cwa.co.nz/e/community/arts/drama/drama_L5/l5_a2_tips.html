      <p>At every opportunity in this work teachers need to encourage students 
        to create full characters and to avoid stereotypes and one dimensional 
        figures. Challenging students to think beyond the obvious will provide 
        a richer basis for the investigative work and the presentations. In the 
        initial character creation work students need to select and create objects 
        of significance that can suggest an event or a part of a person's history. 
        Keep the focus of this initial work on the objects rather than on the 
        artistic process of making them. Set a clear time limit on finding and 
        displaying the objects. This will encourage students to be focused and 
        disciplined in their work. In the presentation stage focus on the similarities 
        and differences between the initial character and the findings of the 
        investigative group. Encourage students to see the richness that is possible 
        in different interpretations of the same material. </p>
