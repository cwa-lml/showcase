              <li> A past with many possibilities</li>

                aspects of character, such as clothing and appearance. </li>
              <li> On the inside of the figure students record feelings or what 
                the character is like inside, for example, unsure, sad, scared, 
                hungry. </li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Freeze-frame images and <a href="http://www.tki.org.elf.internal.cwa.co.nz/e/community/arts/drama/drama_glossary.php#spe">speaking thoughts aloud</a></b> <a href="javascript:popUp(600,276,'NewWindow', 'l4_a1_tips4.html')">[tip]</a></p>
            <p>After reading early chapters of the book students select several 
              key moments/ <a href="http://www.tki.org.elf.internal.cwa.co.nz/e/community/arts/drama/drama_glossary.php#sce">scenes</a> related to the main character. </p>
            <p>In small groups students develop a freeze-frame image showing the 
              characters involved in that event. </p>
            <p>Teacher encourages each group member to think of the words that 
              their character might say with reference to the main character. 
            </p>
            <p>Teacher steps into freeze-frame and taps each participant on the 
              shoulder and gets each to speak aloud their feelings, thoughts, 
              in a word, or phrase. </p>
            <p>After hearing from each participant, students should reflect on 
              what they have learned about the central character and his relationship 
              with other characters. They may note findings and develop a new 
              wallchart showing this information. </p>
            <p>An alternative method of creating freeze-frames and spoken thoughts 
              works as follows: </p>
            <ul>
              <li> After reading the early chapters of the book students divide 
                into groups of five or six and create a sequence of five key moments 
                as <a href="http://www.tki.org.elf.internal.cwa.co.nz/e/community/arts/drama/drama_glossary.php#free">freeze frames</a>. Their task is to convey the particular moment 
                to the audience and for them to guess what is happening. </li>
              <li> Firstly students display their sequence to the rest of the 
                class as an "open/close" exercise in which the audience opens 
                and closes their eyes so that the participants in the freeze frame 
                can reposition themselves. The effect is cinematic and creates 
                a sequence film/type frame. </li>
              <li> Secondly students should run through their freeze frames again 
                with the purpose of having the class explain what is happening 
                from the story.</li>
            </ul>
            <p align="left"><b>Hotseating</b> <a href="javascript:popUp(600,276,'NewWindow', 'l4_a1_tips5.html')">[tip]</a></p>
            <p align="left">Hotseating is an opportunity to interview a character 
              from the story and to explore ideas and attitudes about the role. 
              It may be done as a whole class or in smaller groups. </p>
            <p align="left">Teacher may be in the <a href="http://www.tki.org.elf.internal.cwa.co.nz/e/community/arts/drama/drama_glossary.php#hot">hot seat</a> to model the process 
              first - then students follow. </p>
            <p align="left">Preparation of questions is important. In pairs students 
              can prepare the questions for the characters. Questions could be 
              open-ended, related to the story, or prompt a creative or imaginative 
              shift, for example, encouraging students to think beyond the bounds 
              of the story &#8211; the moment before, the moment after, ten years 
              ago, ten years into the future. Questions may be recorded on the 
              whiteboard as prompts. Phrases like "Can you tell us more about? 
              How did you feel when...? Can you describe... in more detail? Are 
              there are important reasons for? Can you discuss the process of...?" 
              may produce more conceptual answers. </p>
            <p align="left">Students could interview each other in pairs as preparation. 
            </p>
            <p align="left">A volunteer is chosen to model the process in front 
              of the class. </p>
            <p align="left">Class members question the character in role. The 
              teacher's <a href="http://www.tki.org.elf.internal.cwa.co.nz/e/community/arts/drama/drama_glossary.php#rol">role</a> is to protect the student taking the role in case 
              of inappropriate questions. The teacher may also act as prompt. 
            </p>
            <p align="left">It is important that the teacher sets the boundaries 
              for hotseating. Guidelines should ensure: </p>
            <ul>
              <li> That only questions are asked it is not a conversation nor 
                the opportunity to set someone up.</li>
              <li> That questions are addressed to the character and to the role 
                and not to the person playing the role. For example, &quot;Jan, 
                when you....?</li>
              <li></li>
              <p align="left">That if there is more than one character being hotseated 
                at the same time, the characters should not interact with each 
                other. </p>
            </ul>
            <p align="left"><b>De-roling </b> 
            <p align="left">It is important to de-role at the end of a hotseating 
              session. In role, students may speak intense feelings from a perspective 
              other than their own. This involves imaginative identification and 
              the need to be protected when stepping back into reality. 
            <p align="left">There are a number of ways of doing this: 
            <ul>
              <li>making a physical move, for example standing up, stretching, 
                turning around, and then returning to where we are here in the 
                classroom; </li>
              <li>closing eyes, directing a silent thought to the role, and then 
                moving away and back into the groups;</li>
              <li>removing the sign, for example taking off a jersey, or clothing, 
                that marks the boundary between the role and reality; </li>
              <li> shaking out, or brushing off, or taking a big breath as students 
                come out of the role before they return to the class. </li>
            </ul>
            <p align="left"><b>Selecting props</b> 
            <p align="left">The information gained from this work can now be used 
              to select props or clothing to develop the character further and 
              to work towards developing a 90 second &#8211; 2 minute polished 
              scene. Ideas include: 
            <ul>
              <li> Discuss and touch significant symbols, including clothes, or 
                props in a person's life. In Jan's case these include the box, 
                shoes, the sword, an animal, food. These (except the animal) could 
                be brought in an old suitcase and laid out for students to examine. 
                A feather could work as a substitute sign for the chicken. A preparatory 
                game in which students sit in a circle and the objects are passed 
                behind their backs to allow them to examine the texture of the 
                items and to try and guess what they are, will add tactile and 
                thus imaginative involvement. </li>
              <li> Discuss key scenes in the person's life. A timeline could be 
                drawn up. It is important to physicalise this and thus useful 
                to roll out a long sheet of newsprint and have students record 
                the beginning of the character's journey and the end, then divide 
                up the paper by first seeking an important middle event for students 
                to relate to. </li>
              <li> Groups decide on on which scenes they will create and which 
                props could be significant. They need only imagine the props during 
                rehearsal and as they are able to share the suitcase when presenting. 
              </li>
              <li> Students seek dialogue in the text that will help them to create 
                their scene. </li>
              <li> Students may add to this dialogue by improvising several more

              <li> Students create a 90 second &#8211; 2 minute scene. A spread of scenes 
                that will convey points in the character's life. </li>
              <li> Students present the scenes. </li>

            <p><b>Presentation</b> </p>
            <p align="left">Presenting the scene provides options. Teachers need 
              to choose a structure for presentation and guide students clearly 
              through it. It may be a brief scene in which characters move and 
              speak that finishes with another freeze-frame. This gives the students 
              parameters within which to work. 
            <p align="left">Other ideas from the other <a href="http://www.tki.org.elf.internal.cwa.co.nz/e/community/arts/drama/drama_glossary.php#conv">conventions</a> could be incorporated 
              into a presentation. Speaking thoughts aloud might be used as the 
              basis for a scene where the central character speaks thoughts and 
              others use props to <a href="http://www.tki.org.elf.internal.cwa.co.nz/e/community/arts/drama/drama_glossary.php#mim">mime</a> action. 
            <p align="left">The scene could be framed within the character's thoughts, 
              The main character might be speaking his/her thoughts aloud, while 
              others give focus by showing a series of freeze-frame images, for 
              example "I remember the night the soldiers came." In this way students 
              could develop an understanding of the convention of <b>split stage</b>. 
            <p align="left">The scene could be framed within a character's dream 
              with students indicating the <a href="http://www.tki.org.elf.internal.cwa.co.nz/e/community/arts/drama/drama_glossary.php#ele">elements</a> of rising tension through 
              movement or increasing focus on the main character by moving in 
              on them in slow motion. In this way students could develop an understanding 
              of the convention of <b>dream sequence</b>.

              <li> Students will select an appropriate prop or piece of clothing 
                for a role and write or speak about aspects of the role it suggests. 
                These may include for example social status, age, occupation, 
                gender and attitude. They will also talk about how this is carried 
                into their portrayal of a character through use of <a href="http://www.tki.org.elf.internal.cwa.co.nz/e/community/arts/drama/drama_glossary.php#voi">voice</a>, body 
                and space and discovery of the power of new or combined conventions. 
              </li>
              <li> Students will prepare a <a href="http://www.tki.org.elf.internal.cwa.co.nz/e/community/arts/drama/drama_glossary.php#ref">reflection</a> discussing their selection 
                of convention and illustrating how the convention explored the 
                character. This could be written or oral. While most students 
                will begin to explore conventions in new ways, excellent responses 
                will develop entirely new conventions. </li>
