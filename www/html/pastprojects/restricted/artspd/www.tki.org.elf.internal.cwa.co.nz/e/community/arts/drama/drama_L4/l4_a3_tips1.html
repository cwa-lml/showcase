      <p>Students may need to work up the confidence to make vocal sounds especially 
        if they are unusual. Some warm up activities: </p>
      <p><b>Count to 21</b> &#8211; A group of people stand in an inward facing circle. 
        Their task is to count, one at a time, randomly, to 21. (If there is a 
        large group you will need to increase the number). If two people repeat 
        a number the counting must immediately go back to one. This encourages 
        the group to listen and to leave space for others. </p>
      <p><b>Skiffle Group</b> </p>
      <p>Six students stand in a circle <br>
        Student 1 makes a repeated rhythmic sound (or sound sequence) &#8211; not a 
        word. <br>
        Student 2 joins in, fitting a different sound to the pattern. <br>
        One by one all the students join in until there is a sextet producing 
        a rhythmic pattern. <br>
        This can have a theme to it: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>An industrial area </li>
        <li>Fairground </li>
        <li>The bush at night </li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Improvised vocal music </b></p>
      <p>A group of people stand in an inward facing circle. Their task is to 
        improvise vocal music/song together and bring it to a conclusion. Stress: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Support sounds that you hear either by imitating them or harmonising 
          with them, for example, if someone begins to chant "Far far away" join 
          in the chant until it seems time to move away and initiate another pattern 
          or support someone else's offer. </li>
        <li> Keep with the mood. </li>
        <li> Leave space for others to make their sounds. Eventually the song 
          will build to a climax or wind down to a conclusion. A soundscape can 
          simply be repeated sentences or phrases &#8211; a simple way to begin that 
          may increase confidence.</li>
      </ul>
