      <p><b>Tension </b></p>
      <p>There are a variety of ways to add tension: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Time &#8211; put a time limit on the task. "We cannot have the painting 
          out in the air for too long or it will start to decompose." </li>
        <li> Competition for resources </li>
        <li> Life threatening situations for the characters </li>
        <li> Risk for the environment </li>
        <li> Conflict </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Just as a teacher or facilitator can inject these tensions from inside 
        or outside the drama so can the students. A discussion on accepting the 
        offers made within a group and expanding or advancing on them will assist 
        students in understanding how to use the process. Expanding means going 
        into more detail, advancing means accepting the narrative and adding to 
        the events. Person 1 "These bones look very old". Person 2 (Expanding) 
        "Yes and over here, look, here are some fragments of clothing". Person 
        2 (Advancing) "He was just sitting behind his desk, smirking, then he 
        got up and called for the DP to come and remove us, he comes in and grabs 
        us each around the wrist". </p>
      <p>The teacher or facilitator at times can act as conductor and call advance 
        or extend according to what they perceive the narrative needs.</p>
