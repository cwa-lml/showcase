      <p><b>Setting the context </b></p>
      <p>Never underestimate the importance of setting the context. The more thorough 
        it is, the more the students will engage in the drama. </p>
      <p>A real cake, a wrapped present, the discussion of what would be appropriate 
        for the present. Start to show the students the possibilities, asking 
        them to tell about similar events in their lives will also help build 
        the belief. </p>
      <p>If another character is to be introduced make sure the students know 
        many details about this person, give them a clear biography &#8211; not just 
        the details relevant for the drama. (See it as an iceberg &#8211; you need the 
        tip that is above water, the belief building process is giving them some 
        of the ice that lies below the surface of the water.) </p>
      <p>Always draw analogies with things that the students can relate to. In 
        setting the context it is important to begin with statements like the 
        following: </p>
      <p>Today we are going to make a play about a husband and wife who are celebrating 
        their golden anniversary.</p>
