      <p><b>Discovering the object </b></p>
      <ul>
        <li> Consider hiding the object in the school. </li>
        <li> The discovery could even start the drama (particularly with students 
          who have had some experience in working in this way). </li>
        <li> A suitcase could be sitting in the middle of the room when the students 
          return from the lunchbreak. The teacher could move straight into a low 
          status role and question the students about what they think the object 
          signifies. </li>
        <li> Things that are ripped and need piecing together add to the excitement 
          and learning opportunities; but only if it fits the context of the drama. 
          A letter should only be ripped if there is a reason, for example, the reader did 
          not like the content, or had decided not to send it.</li>
