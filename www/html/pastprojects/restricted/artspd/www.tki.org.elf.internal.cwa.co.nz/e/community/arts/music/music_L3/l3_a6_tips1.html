<li>The symbolic representations of sound is useful for hearing impaired students.    They like to be able to "see" what they are going to play.
<li>Use visual cues whenever possible.    Have pictures of instruments and found sounds; use storybooks, and videos. 
<li>Work in very small groups whenever possible; a teacher aid might take the student(s) who has hearing loss in a separate group from the class at times.
<li>Each new sound needs to be heard on its own.    Students who are hearing impaired have difficulty discriminating sounds, and picking out a specific sound from others in the environment, so eliminate background noise as much as possible.
<li>When working in a group, seat the students in a circle so the child or children who have hearing impairment, can see other people's faces.
<li>Allow students who are hearing impaired to have lots of hands on experimentation with sound.
<li>To ensure each task is understood, give examples before asking for ideas.   If another student offers an idea, make sure everyone in the group has heard and understood what was said.
