      <p><b>Tension</b></p>
      <p>Once the tension is introduced consider following it through and start 
        to create a story &#8211; someone is late, what are they going to do? How do 
        they feel? (The late person need never actually arrive). It is through 
        the tension that the drama is created. The students can express their 
        feelings by freezing the whole group and the teacher going round several 
        (or all) of the students, touching them on the shoulder and asking them 
        to tell the whole group how they feel. [Note: feelings are powerful and 
        they are what makes drama a powerful medium &#8211; they can also trigger other 
        feelings in the students from earlier memories. If this happens it needs 
        to be handled sensitively.]</p>
