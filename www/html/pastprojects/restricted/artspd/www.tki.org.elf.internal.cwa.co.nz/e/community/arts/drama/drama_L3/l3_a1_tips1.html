      <p><b>Mime</b> </p>
      <ul>
        <li> You do not need to be too technical. This is not intended as mime 
          in the Marcel Marceau highly skilled and stylised art form but instead 
          it is about developing in students the ability to "sign" with confidence. 
        </li>
        <li> The students need to be able to portray something through clear movement. 
          Help them to work out what is necessary and cut out all other movement. 
          If you do go into anything technical look at making a clear focus by 
          not splitting the focus (have two or more things happening at the 
          same time, so that the audience doesn't know what to look at). </li>
        <li> Facial expressions are important. </li>
        <li> Clear sight lines for anyone watching (that is, if there is an "audience" 
          turn the action towards them). </li>
        <li> Make movements big &#8211; exaggerate them. </li>
        <li> Execute them more slowly than in real life. </li>
        <li> Condense time &#8211; if a shower would normally take 5 minutes we don't 
          need to see it all &#8211; large washing gestures are what is required. </li>
        <li> Focus your attention on one action and do not allow other actions 
          to compete with it. </li>
        <li> If a prop is being used, note that a good prop is an aid to the mime 
          and not a distraction. </li>
        <li> If dealing with imaginary objects remember the positioning of the 
          object and if you return to it, take it from the same place. </li>
        <li> Think about attitude &#8211; a physical position that expresses a psychological 
          state. </li>
        <li> Sounds either made with the body, voice, or simple instruments can 
          add mood, tension, and meaning to the mime.</li>
