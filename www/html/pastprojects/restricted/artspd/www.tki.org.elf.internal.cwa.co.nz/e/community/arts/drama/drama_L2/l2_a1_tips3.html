      <p>Make these as authentic as possible &#8211; a child will not accept a picture 
        of something as being the equivalent of that thing. Do not use a drawing 
        or photocopy for the real thing. </p>
      <p>To begin with, for some children, you should collect objects and prepare 
        related roles to which they will immediately relate. Some suggestions 
        are a broken toy, a ripped photo of a child, an empty party bag, a postcard 
        with a simple message. Your objects may be part of drama worlds where 
        animals can talk, toys can come alive and inanimate objects have personalities 
        so this gives rise to a host of possibilities.</p>
