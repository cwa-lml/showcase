<ul>
<li>Most children are used to doing this all the time and used to being assigned roles by each other "You be the princess and I'll be the other princess." so they will certainly accept being given their roles by the teacher.
<li>They do not have to present performance level acting skills &#8211; children can be loosely in role to achieve your objectives.
<li>Make some ground rules before you begin.  Make sure that being in role is not seen as licence for the children to behave badly towards each other.
<li>The children need to have some degree of trust in each other &#8211; some preparation trust games may assist this:
<br>

<ul>
<li>Swapping a toy for a session then giving it back unharmed
<li>Leading each other around with their eyes shut
<li>Moving around the room and not touching anyone (you can  decrease the amount of space available so that the children have to be really careful about not banging into each other)
<li>Saying something nice about each other
<li>Talking about peoples' feelings and how they might hurt
</ul>
<br>


<li>The children can be given a high degree of protection by being placed in role.  They can have a different name (not one of someone known to them unless this is for a particular purpose).  Do not allow silly names.  They can also be distanced from their real selves by putting them in a different place, a different time, different gender and a position in society very different to their own.  In this way everyone will know that what they are saying is not them saying it and they will not be teased or ridiculed later.

<li>Just as the teacher in role can have a prop so can the children.  The prop can help them to go into role and to demark the time in role.  It can be as simple as a sticky "Introducing" badge with their new name (and title) on it, an arm band, a hat, or a badge.  As part of the preparation for the drama you may have them bring something from home (have spares for those who forget).

<li>If the children are to be in role as experts allow them the opportunity to "skill up". At the same time there will be many things the students will know &#8211; the drama will assist them with accessing this.

<li>The children need to be brought out of role at the end of the session &#8211; especially if the children have been involved in a disagreement or the material is sensitive.  A debrief on the drama and a reflection on the work done is important and reinforces the learning.
