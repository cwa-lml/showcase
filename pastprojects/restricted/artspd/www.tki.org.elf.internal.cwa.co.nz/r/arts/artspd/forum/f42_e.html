<p>Excerpts from forum discussion with Ann Brodie (National Co-ordinator &#8211; the Visual Arts)<br>
20 November 2002</p>

<p>
<b>Val Duthie:</b><br> 
Kia ora, welcome to our final arts forum for 2002. Our guest online is Ann Brodie.  The focus of our discussions will be time-based art. See <i>Action Arts Issue 30</i> for further information. We will be discussing: </p>
<ul>
<li>what time-based art means</li>
<li>the materials required to create time-based art works</li>
<li>ways to introduce time-based art into your school programme</li>
<li>artists who focus on time-based art.</li> 
</ul>

<p>The definition in the curriculum for time-based art is: "<i>Time-based art are works that are sequenced through time, that change as we view them, and that may be ephemeral (e.g., video, kinetic sculpture, performance works)</i>".</p>
<br>

<p><i>What are the main benefits for students of introducing time-based art in the classroom?</i></p>

<p><b>Bryce:</b><br>
What do you see as the main benefits for students of introducing time-based art into our classroom programmes?</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b><br>
I guess new fields to explore, to conquer, to enjoy! An additional spin-off would be greater involvement in IT skills if that were the type of time-based art to be engaged in.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Wendy:</b><br>
I have a couple of questions as I am trying to work out what time-based art really is.</p>

<ol>
<li>I know that artist Andy Warhol filled 610 time capsules and sealed them in cardboard boxes, trunks and filing cabinets, and that these are currently housed in the Andy Warhol Museum Archives. I know that these time capsules are called works of art. Would they come under the category of time-based work? If so, why?</li>
<li>I have also come across the term 'Mail Art' or 'Correspondence art'. It's a term applied to art sent through the post rather than displayed or sold through conventional commercial channels. It could be anything from postcards, books, photocopied images, or rubber stamps and postage stamps designed by artists, concrete poetry, etc. Is that time-based art? If so, why?</li> 
</ol>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b><br>
Great questions! In considering them I decided we will all be on a learning curve and dialogue like this will be essential. Re Warhol: His capsules are time capsules. They contain art works. In my opinion that does not make them time-based art. If so, then an unopened art book would be a similar candidate. If, however, the art works in the capsules were to be designed so that time affected (altered) them, then they would be. Better still if a closed circuit TV recorded the changes at intervals, they would be time-based. Re mail art: I see those as discrete art works. The fact that they are posted doesn't alter their images. The curriculum defines time-based art. The definition will be added to as we get ourselves more familiar in preparing to introduce the art form in to schools. We are keen to add sound-producing art works to the list as a tempting taster!</p>

<p><b>Jean:</b><br>
You mentioned flick books that show a person or object appearing to change as we flick the book. I guess that shows a sequence of time. Val mentioned Chris Booth's work that decays and changes over time. If you combine, for example, a photograph taken a hundred years ago with one taken today in an art work, would that be enough to call it time-based?</p>

<p><b>Jocelyn:</b><br>
I was visiting Wellington earlier this year and saw Polytech students working on a performance work outside the City Library. There was road works in the street, and the students had asked the City Council if they could use part of the dugout road for a 24-hour period. The students filled the dugout trench in the road with pots of beautiful native plants and dug them in to look as if they were growing there. Passers-by were really puzzled and it generated a lot of discussion among my group. Next day the City Council workers came along and fixed up the road so that it was sealed again and the plants were gone. The artwork has left me with a lasting impression of how the city has overwhelmed or destroyed nature. It also made me realise how powerful plant life is and how it can generate even in a crack between the pavement. I think it was the suddenness and shock of seeing the plants growing in the road followed so quickly with the road being resurfaced again that has made such an impression on me. The time element had been manipulated and it was really effective.</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b><br>
Also there are exciting things like Thaumatropes, Phenakistoscopes and Zoetropes.  Try this web site to discover what they are if your dictionary doesn't assist: <a href="http://www.sofweb.vic.edu.au/arts/samples/media/lv4.htm" target="_blank">www.sofweb.vic.edu.au/arts/samples/media/lv4.htm</a>. What is time-based art? So far, we say it is arts works that sequence through time, change as we view them and may be ephemeral (e.g. video, kinetic sculpture, performance works). I am noticing the conceptual art ideas, such as photos recording something that changes over time, is not included here. We are on a learning curve.</p>

<p><b>Bryce:</b><br>
In your reply to Wendy and the question about time capsules, I just wonder if we could see Warhol's work as time-based art because, while the contents of the capsules may not have changed, the world outside the capsules will have changed since they were archived. So, when we open the capsules and have another look, there will be a change. We will have changed our understanding of the contents of the capsules, as the passage of time will make us look at them afresh so to speak. Could we see it that way?</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b><br>
Art works done in the environment do engage us with interesting concepts, like the effects of time, temperature, wind, tidewater, etc. All of these can be components of a time-based art experience. What materials would you need? It would be hard to be definitive about materials. There are so many ways of engaging in time-based art. Any and all of the materials usually encountered in art making could be appropriate, as well as computer software. I know that Kidpix and CorelDraw are providing assistance in many classrooms, and, for recording, digital cameras or analogue and videos. Low-tech approaches could be very active and involving. I know of artists who use masking tape to create (draw) images on walls. They record the image alter the tape placement and record the next image and so on, and there you are... an image that moves! Val has close connections with such an artist. She might even have some recordings?</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b><br>
I do know several artists who are involved in this kind of work. For example, the medium one artist uses is plain ordinary duct tape. The tape is applied to any surface such as a wall, a hospital corridor, a square, such as Cathedral Square in Christchurch, or any large public space. The tape is used as you would use a pencil to make a line drawing and is applied to the surface to tell a story of some kind.  During the development of the work, a video camera records what people passing by say about the work. This is then put up on a web site so that anyone can interact. The work is often done during the evening and night so that the public finds this artwork when they travel to work in the morning. Within 24 hours, the tape is removed from the surface and by the time folks go home from work, the huge 'drawing' has gone. The video recording may still be available on the web though, so that people can interact from around the world. It's quite an experience to see the work, as it is large, and then to not see the work.</p> 

<p><b>Sue:</b><br>
With your example Val and the one in a Wellington road, it sounds like there is an element of social commentary. Is this a thread that runs through time-based art? What is the difference between an installation and time-based art, Ann? Or does it depend on the conditions?</p> 

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>What materials would we need to be at the cutting edge of time-based art?</i></p>

<p><b>Murray:</b><br>
If we are to introduce this into our class work, we could do this simply by using paper, and pen or pencil, and making a flick book, right? If we want to be more adventurous, we would need to use sound equipment, film perhaps? If we were to be 'at the cutting edge' of using time-based art, what materials would we need?</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b><br>
What is cutting edge in terms of materials? The tertiary art institutions are doing great work in this field. Along with practising artists, they are leading the way. We won't be cutting edge in schools, though we will walk before we run, I guess, especially as we are on new ground. In preparing a time-based art resource for schools, we will have more discussions with these sorts of experts. They are "using all sorts of digital processes" to quote Struan Ashby of Massey University. Our students are very interested and fearless when it comes to technology, so I am sure we will find them willing to experiment.</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b><br>
Video cameras. There are a lot of video cameras around that can be bought fairly cheaply for students to use... the 'old fashioned' analogue ones. They tape to VHS easily and are easy to use. I recommend that schools look into buying one and teaching students about composition, scripting, directing, short movies and documentaries.</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b><br>
Sound-producing art could be, for example, an Aeolian harp catching the wind to make sound (involves time and a recording or ear to hear it!!) or the effect of waves crashing into a series of pipes. I recall such a work being created at Dunedin's St Clair beach by a musician some years ago. It is a lovely thought that one could create such an artwork that could moan away on its own unless a hearing creature passed by. Len Lye's recent kinetic sculptures on exhibition in Wellington incorporated sound perhaps as an unavoidable by-product, but the sound was integral to the effect for the viewer. Hey! In August of 2003 there will be a showcase of time-based art at the Youth Arts 2003 event in Wellington. I am looking for schools where time-based art is happening and for this purpose happening well (no, Val, not a lot of schools have been seen to be involved in significant time-based art). Re. digital art works: if the digital techniques are used as an art-making medium, just as paint or ink are, then it is only a version of an art-making medium, not time-based. Just because it takes time to produce an artwork, which then sits and emanates its aesthetic qualities, does not make the work time-based. Sue, that dance performance occurring before a backdrop is not a time-based artwork either. Any comments/thoughts anyone?</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>Art movements and artists who have used time-based art</i></p>

<p><b>Jean:</b><br>
I've been following this discussion and surfed the web to see what I could find. I was amazed to find a list of process time-based art movements, as I hadn't heard of half of them.<br>
Here are some of them: </p>
<ul>
<li>DaDa </li>
<li>Fluxus</li> 
<li>Performance/conceptual</li> 
<li>Reformance Art and the Body (Feminist)</li> 
<li>70s Video/Portapack Art.</li>
</ul> 
<p>and artists:</p>
<ul>
<li>John Cage</li> 
<li>Ray Johnson</li> 
<li>Joseph Beuys</li>
<li>Vio Acconci</li> 
<li>Carolee Schneemann</li> 
<li>Chris Burden</li> 
<li>Suzanne Lacy</li> 
<li>Judy Malloy</li> 
<li>Martha Rosler</li> 
<li>William Wegman.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b><br>
Thank you for that list. We must investigate. I have remembered the wild French artist Jean Tinguely who made automated plate-smashing machines, sound included! There are lots for us to discover! </p>

<p><b>Tess:</b><br>
I just find this whole area very exciting and the prospects for new and innovative ways to communicate through art can be explored through I.C.T and computers via multimedia manipulation, animations and video work. Also very important to acknowledge what has come before, including the magical works of Len Lye... New Zealand's answer to a new horizon in art works.</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b><br>
It is early days for me to be able to readily identify artists engaged in time-based work. By mid 2003 we will be well on the way. We have talked about Andy Goldsworthy before (he used natural materials). Len Lye, of course, is an icon for us all. His early music videos using direct film (he worked onto film directly with colour and scratchings, etc). You can soon access videos of his work from the film archive in Wellington. Try its website for information: <a href="http://www.filmarchive.org.nz/" target="_blank">www.filmarchive.org.nz</a>. Look for the work of Richard Long. Schools are finding Power Point very useful for time-based work adding sound, and scanning in art works which can be digitally altered, (secondary of course, or intermediate). Look at the two time-based learning examples on TKI <i>The Arts Unwrapped: level 3 Animated animals</i> and <i>level 5 Layers in Time</i>. The latter has low-tech options included. I am preparing an exemplar on the former at the moment. I know we have mentioned this on the forum before. Another school will feature at Youth Arts 2003 working on the layers-in-time one.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>What about visual arts planning for next year?</i></p>

<b>Val Duthie:</b><br>
Could you direct us to some artists that focus on time-based work so that we could have a look at that? As time is moving on, it would be good to have a look at visual arts planning for next year.

<p><b>Ann:</b><br>
OK, planning. Any questions problems to anticipate: one thought from me. It seems unwise to decide which strands elements and principles you will do before you have decided on the actual unit content and focus. Sure the art form can be decided on ahead, but those other details do change depending on the actual activity. Comments, other opinions?</p>

<p><b>Val:</b><br>
I have identified some useful planning sites for you to look at on The Arts Online.<br>
