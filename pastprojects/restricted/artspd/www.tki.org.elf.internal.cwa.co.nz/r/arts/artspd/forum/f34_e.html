<p>Excerpts from forum discussion with Peter O'Connor (National Coordinator Drama)<br>
14 August 2002</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b><br>
Kia ora, welcome to our Drama forum with guest on line Peter O'Connor (National Coordinator - Drama).  
During this forum we will continue our discussion on 'aesthetic education.' Peter raises the question: Is aesthetic education just about form and with little concern about the content?  For background material on this topic, see: <a href="http://www.mccallumtheatre.com/instituteaesthetic.html" target="_blank">http://www.mccallumtheatre.com/instituteaesthetic.html</a> (McCallum Institute of Aesthetic Education), <a href="http://www.newfoundations.com/GALLERY/Greene.html" target="_blank">http://www.newfoundations.com/GALLERY/Greene.html</a> (the educational theory of Maxine Greene), <a href="http://www.nationaldrama.co.uk/html/future.html" target="_blank">http://www.nationaldrama.co.uk/html/future.html</a> Theatre in School Conference 2002 (Hong Kong).</p>

<p><i>How do you define aesthetic education?</i></p>

<b>Robert:</b><br>
I have a couple of questions really. 1) How do you define aesthetic education? 2) What do you see as the difference(s) between aesthetic education in USA and NZ? In our curriculum statement it says: 
<i>"Drama in the NZ Curriculum enables students to link their own imaginations, thoughts and feelings with drama practice and history in ways that give voice to the cultural diversity of New Zealand. Students become increasingly literate in drama as they work with the elements of role, time and space, action, tension, and focus and develop skills in using the techniques of voice, movement, gesture, and facial expression. They use these elements and techniques with the conventions of drama to add richer meaning and colour to their drama work"</i>. Through the curriculum strands, our students explore <i>"in or through drama"</i>.

<p><b>Wayne:</b><br>
Peter asks whether aesthetic education (AE) may be more about form than content. I think that it depends upon the person delivering it. Firstly let me outline what AE may be. Maxine Greene (philosopher in residence, Lincoln Centre Institute, New York) writes that it is <i>'an initiation into new ways of seeing, hearing, feeling, moving, a reaching out for meanings, a learning to learn, integral to the development of persons &#8211; to their cognitive, perceptual, emotional, and imaginative development'</i> (Maxine Greene, <i>'Variations on a Blue Guitar'</i>, 2001, p.7). She also defines AE as <i>'an intentional undertaking designed to nurture appreciative, reflective, cultural, participatory engagements with the arts by enabling learners to notice what there is to be noticed...'</i>(p.6). It is AE's intention to awaken people to the arts and through them to open an awareness of how and what the world is &#8211; to enable imagination and creativity to thrive &#8211; quite an undertaking!!! Having attended a workshop for 10 days at the McCallum Institute California I can verify that the experience is hands-on. The student is exposed to problems an artist would have been confronted with in the creation of a work of art. The student must produce a work, problem solving, creating and imaging. In this way when the work of art is viewed/heard the student is engaged, it has more meaning and thus opens the way for an aesthetic experience (aesthetic: the mode of experience brought into being by encounters with works of art). Content is a large part of the process, as a way of understanding the form.</p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b><br>
Some juicy questions to start with. Robert first up. I guess Wayne's use of Maxine Greene's definitions is a good place to start. The Lincoln Institute also uses phrases like: <i>'aesthetics involves understanding how people see, hear imagine think and act in relation to art'</i>. Aesthetics physically studies the creative process and accentuates the journey &#8211; the journey of learning and living. Dewey, I guess even predates Greene and in 1934 in <i>Art as Experience</i> was writing about the central place of the arts. I'm always a little wary of Dewey (his views on race are interesting to put it mildly). He says <i>'in order to perceive more fully, beholders (of art) have to create their own experiences: since without acts of recreation objects could not be perceived as art. Perhaps it is more accurate to think of them as reservoirs of possibility, potential sources of aesthetic experience of those who know how to attend'.</i> Greene suggests that the aesthetic educator understands that the more the beholder can come to notice and to know the more he or she is likely to hear and see. Attentiveness is the key to perception. My understanding of aesthetics education is that the work always originates in another's piece of art (usually that of a professional and a grown-up artist) and that the integrity of that artwork is always validated rather than challenged. So an aesthetic education programme always begins either with a piece of visual art or an existing piece of theatre, or piece of music or dance. The students explore through arts processes themselves the nature of the art under discussion. Lincoln Institute uses terms like <i>'aesthetic puzzles'</i>, which can be reviewed endlessly. Clearly there is a role in New Zealand for such an approach and a way into learning about and through drama. However, often in drama education, we start with nothing but ourselves and a desire to create something new. Aesthetics education is simply, I guess, a subset of the wider world of study we undertake in the drama curriculum.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>It is important to focus on more than just aesthetics, i.e. on content and context as well.</i></p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b><br>
Hi Sue, Boal suggests that in drama we are always searching for the form to meet the content. In a discussion I had with an aesthetic education person from Lincoln whilst in Hong Kong I challenged her in her description of work done by a group of students working around a theatre production of the <i>Ugly Duckling</i>. The students considered a whole range of the art form issues surrounding the story and its theatrical presentation but failed to address the central content question of a story which is about who decides what is ugly, and how do we belong to others and why are such stories retold so that people feel increasingly bound to conform to social pressures of what is okay. To simply view the <i>Ugly Duckling</i> in this case as just a piece of art and ask kids to work through the arts processes alone with out considering the content of what they are working on seems to do a disservice to both the art work itself and the kids. I guess I get very nervous about classrooms of kids learning skills in drama, especially acting skills without a wider context in which that happens. There are some drama classrooms where skills acquisition becomes the way of working and that occurs in decontextualised frames. Its not very good drama teaching and I don't think it meet the requirements of the new curriculum either.</p>

<p><b>Wayne:</b><br>
Greene also says that we need to create situations in which active learning in the most vibrant sense can occur. There must be two modes of action: what we call 'doing' and what we call ' attending'. As Sue suggests even though they are distinctive modes of action, they infuse one another.</p>

<p><b>Wayne:</b><br>
Yes, I must agree that context may be waylaid in the study of processes. Focus works lead a team of working artists to a line of inquiry that sets up the objectives for activities to be work shopped. The team may choose whatever tact they like depending upon what they see as their major focus of learning for the unit. However... reflection and personal journal writing is critical to the process. It is encouraged at those times of reflection that themes and wider ramifications should be considered. This is perhaps the time when your questions could be reflected upon.</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b><br>
In response to your comments above: <i>"who decides what is ugly, and how do we belong to others and why are such stories retold so that people feel increasingly bound to conform to social pressures of what is okay?"</i> Isn't AE about experiential and discovery-based study of a work of art in which activities are designed around the line of inquiry to actively engage students in the learning? Surely this would/could provide for an inquiry about who decides etc. There are, as Wayne has said," different modes of learning" and these are not discreet.</p>  

<p>Re your comment: <i>"my understanding of aesthetics education is that the work always originates in another's piece of art (usually that of a professional and a grown up artist) and that the integrity of that art work is always validated rather than challenged"</i> Doesn't all creative work evolve from or become a synthesis of what is seen or experienced elsewhere?</p>

<p><b>Wayne:</b><br>
I believe your definition of AE is essentially correct. Another quote from Greene says, <i>"We understand AE to be a mode of educating that provokes persons in their uniqueness and diversity to 'learn the languages' of a range of art forms so that they may be enabled to attend consciously, with passion and with care to what appears before them as painting, dance, performance, musical piece with the potential to be grasped as work of art"</i>.</p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b><br>
Agreed Val, all work in the arts builds both on all other work done and also that of our lived experience. I guess my sense of aesthetics education is that it always starts with the artwork of some one from outside the group as the stimulus. This is the starter from which the student's own art making springs, and that is not necessarily how you always start a drama lesson. You may start from a story that springs from the group, a real photograph, and an idea from the group itself. I guess it's simply a matter of where it starts. </p> 

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>Why is drama part of the essential learning areas?</i></p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b><br>
It is evident that developing literacies in the arts is a central and unifying idea in our (NZ) curriculum.</p>

<p>What, in your opinion, is so essential about drama that it has become an essential learning area discipline?</p>

<p>Can you explain for us how this is different from what is happening in USA and at the Aesthetic Education Programme (AEP) at the McCallum Institute where AEP gives education tools and techniques to integrate the arts with the existing curriculum?</p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b><br>
I don't know what drove the wisdom and common sense of those brave people who said Drama was essential for our curriculum. I guess it might have been because <i>"Imagining what it is like to be someone other than yourself is at the core of our humanity. It is the essence of compassion, and it is the beginning of morality."</i> (Neelands) Regardless of anything else, the process of acting as if we are someone else, as we do in our play as children or as actors on a stage is what drama is all about. Both child play and theatre acknowledge that drama is a central process by which we come to know more about ourselves by becoming some one else in a fiction. When drama wasn't on the curriculum the good news was that kids still spent large chunks of their time exploring in dramatic play in the playground. My feeling is that the most important and best learning was happening out there rather than in the classrooms.</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b><br>
I can see how, as this is the first time in New Zealand that we have a curriculum which provides a framework about drama, that there could be a danger that if we emphasise the extrinsic rather than the intrinsic value of drama that we could lose the basis of learning that we are trying to encourage. Perhaps we want to make it 'sticky' first.</p>

<p><b>Sue:</b><br>
Do you see aesthetic education and the literacy model our curriculum is based on having commonalities/differences?</p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b><br>
Yes Sue, I think there are big similarities between the two approaches. Both value the arts experience and the reflective process, both talk about engaging and exciting the journeys of self discovery in the arts. Maxine Greene is clearly one of the foremost thinkers and doers in arts education in the last thirty years. I guess what we have over aesthetic education is the four strands and in particular the UC strand. It is what makes our document a world-beater.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>How can we integrate aesthetic education and still address the student as artist?</i></p>

<p><b>Jean:</b><br>
Can you suggest how we could best integrate aesthetic education into the classroom so that we still address the student as artist?</p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b><br>
There are heaps. Let's look, for example, at using a piece of visual art. Lets say <i>The Mona Lisa</i>. It might be that this becomes a springboard for the students to question, through hot seating, a whole range of characters in Lisa's life. For example, her boyfriend who paid for the sitting, or her mother, or Lisa herself. We might, through day-in-the-life convention, explore what she did before or after the painting was done. We might use teacher in role convention to start a process drama like:</p>

<ul>
<li>"'I have to get my portrait done', Mum says, and I just don't know what to wear". (Costuming)</li>
<li>"I don't know how to sit. You don't have any ideas do you...?"</li>
<li>You might track Lisa through other moments in her life.</li>
<li>Freeze frames at different points and then considering the artists purposes in presenting them in different way might make for fun work</li>
<li>How about as the robbers of the Mona Lisa in the 1920s (I think), and</li>
<li>Planning, in a drama, how to sell it and a marketing strategy or something. Or in role as advertising agency with the rights to use it for anything and planning a campaign around it.</li>
</ul>

<p>The starters that you get in aesthetics education are really strong. Dorothy Heathcote suggests the quality of any drama work is dependent on the quality of the stimulus. Something Maxine Green instinctively knew.</p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b><br> 
I think when we teach drama we must teach the skills and techniques to assist students to make good art, but we must always consider for what purpose has that art been made. It seems that the old content versus form or process versus product debate is a dead duck in the water, as teachers must be doing both or all four. Drama isn't merely a product and it isn't merely a process. My concern is that drama is always about something and therefore you must give the opportunity to explore what it is about as you explore and shape what it is. For example, a drama piece that simply explored the issues around <i>The Ugly Duckling</i> even if it was using drama processes to do that which then failed to teach about and through the processes about the drama itself would be flawed work. Likewise work where kids simply got to act out the story or tussled with the artistic issues of a production without considering the issues in the story would be sold short. In that way I guess form and content become intertwined. Fleming suggests, for example, that to work through <i>King Lear</i> so that you can retell the lines with accuracy and yet still know nothing of the miseries of old age is to denounce the very essence of drama.</p>

<p><b>Jean:</b><br>
In our previous discussion on aesthetic education, Janinka Greenwood described aesthetic education as more than artistic as it impacts on social awareness and on how we make sense of society. It also refers to how we respond with our feeling and not just our logic. Is that your understanding too?</p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b><br>
Janinka is right, I think, when she draws the arts into the notion of the social contract in which it exists. It is the transformative nature of the arts that makes all the difference. It connects to our feelings and our spiritual being. How is this for a juicy quote on what the arts can offer? <i>Art is part of the answer &#8211; not as a panacea but because art has a way of going into the hurt place and cleaning it. Some wounds never heal but they need not remain infected...</i> </p>

<p><i>...It is not ineffectual game playing, it is a way of re-energising people who have been hit hard by bewilderment and despair. To understand our lives, and to keep them in context, not unmoored into lonely seas, we need wisdom and truth... Art can be the creative open space that gives us room to rebuild where there is no steel and glass &#8211; the space in our hearts.</i> Jeanette Winterstrom.</p>

<p><b>Wayne:</b><br>
I know we are interested in drama as an art form. In working with children though I find my greatest moments occur when a sullen or unconfident child suddenly gets 'turned-on'. From these liberating moments I see those children transform across the school. These times are special and there are more of them than I would have thought. I think this is why New Zealand is including drama into the curriculum. What do you think?</p>

<p><b>Wayne:</b><br>
At the McCallum Institute they showed us that anything could be used as a focus artwork. One person used a wedding ring, I used a child's toy to develop a line of inquiry. The "what is art"? debate means you can use anything as a stimulus to imagine and create. </p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b><br>
It is interesting isn't it that if I was to say drama teaching was about teaching about acting, most people not involved in drama education would agree but it would stir up a hornets nest with drama educators. Yet for me it is about the actor on the stage but as important is in creating the social actor. To create someone who acts rather than passively waits to be acted upon. The young person Wayne describes who finds the confidence to speak to say something and to do something. That's the kind of thing that excites me. It's about creating people who are the agents of social change rather than the victims.</p>

<p><b>Wayne:</b><br>
Yes, my point exactly. Ask a class to bring in something they consider to be a work of art and another object they think is not. Put them all in the middle of the room. Then pick them up one by one and ask the class to debate which is and which is not a work of art. They will find it impossible to reach agreement.</p>
