<h2 class="h2-forum">Importance of Drama Questions</h2>

<p><a href="index_e.html">Back to Archived Forum Discussion index</a></p>

<p>Excerpts from forum discussion with Peter O'Connor (National Coordinator Drama)<br>
14 October 2002
</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b><br> 
Kia ora, welcome to this drama forum with Peter O'Connor (National Coordinator &#8211; Drama) as our guest online. This week we will be discussing "What is unique about drama questions and why they are so important to learning in drama?" Effective questioning is more than just asking questions. Instead, it's about inquiry leading to understanding. Even more so, it means possessing skills and attitudes that permit you to seek resolutions to questions and issues while you construct new knowledge. An old adage states: <i>"Tell me and I forget, show me and I remember, involve me and I understand"</i>. </p>

<p><i>How can you guide children to think for themselves when questioning?</i></p>

<p><b>Carol:</b><br>
About using questions in drama, there must be a fine line between putting words in children's mouths and getting them to think for themselves. If a teacher is asking (page 7 from the guidelines) <i>"What tone of voice will he use to warn his mother of danger?"</i> and then uses a tone of voice for an example &#8211; possibly doing this while asking that question. Will the child imitate the teacher or will the prompt give them a starting point for exploring tones of voice? How can you guide children in this situation to think for themselves?
</p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b><br>
Re: modelling the answer in regards to vocal techniques, I guess this depends on what you want the question to do. If it's to prompt or remind, then to model the appropriate tone is fine. If the question is to challenge or to open other possibilities then I guess I would try out different vocal tones to see if that provokes a response. I am interested in the manner in which questions happen in the drama classroom. In most teacher learner situations the teacher already knows the answer to the question. "What is the capital of France? What did the author mean when he wrote..?" All these sorts of questions pre-supposes the teacher knows the answer and the game is about trying to find out that answer. In role work of course we ask genuine questions, questions to which we don't know the answer. Dorothy Heathcote described it beautifully when she said <i>"In the drama, when I asked, where is the bucket? and the child replied "Here it is, I'll get it for her" Not only did I not know where the bucket was but in the very act of her answering, the child created the bucket and did so from her own imaginative stirrings."</i> Drama provides all sorts of opportunities for such questions. And then there is the way that kids can ask genuine questions in role themselves.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>Is there something unique about drama questions or is it 'good' open ended questioning skills?</i></p>

<p><b>Tim:</b><br>
I'm really interested in this topic, as I believe that children can be very responsive to 'appropriate' questioning. I think that open-ended questions such as 'How has the actor made you feel? Were you surprised by...? What is the main theme of...? What would this character do if...?' are all useful beginnings as they help focus on what students understand, their ability to reason, and their ability to apply that knowledge. They provide an opportunity for students to explain and expand on their ideas. In general, these questions require complex thinking and provide a range of solutions. It's tougher on us as teachers though, as open-ended questions require us to interpret and provide further questions that will support the children to interpret and find new solutions. I'm wondering, however, if there is something unique about drama questions, or is it 'good' questioning skills that you are referring to?</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b><br>
For those who want more information on open-ended questions you may wish to have a look at these sites below: 
<a href="http://www.trainingwheels4ece.com/talk/open.html" target="_blank">http://www.trainingwheels4ece.com/talk/open.html</a><br>
<a href="http://www.jhu.edu/gifted/teaching/strategies/analysis/openendedquestions.htm" target="_blank">http://www.jhu.edu/gifted/teaching/strategies/analysis/openendedquestions.htm</a></p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b><br>
I think Tim that there are generic skills to good questioning but that there are unique qualities to good drama questions. Here are some questions I used in a drama a few days ago.</p>

<ul>
<li>What is your name?</li> 
<li>So you're a net maker?</li>
<li>How long have you being making nets?</li> 
<li>How did you learn?</li> 
<li>Is it a job you like?</li> 
<li>What's the part you like best?</li> 
<li>I guess it must be difficult... (the pause here is an excellent question)</li> 
<li>Could you show me what you do first thing in the morning when you start work as a still image?</li> 
<li>When I tap you on the upper arm can you tell me what you're usually thinking at this time of the morning?</li>
</ul>

<p>All these questions were used to build the students belief in the drama we were about to take.  The student answered in role and in doing so created the character himself. No right or wrong answers and totally enabling.</p>

<p>Out of role I asked:</p>

<ul>
<li>What are these net makers like as people?</li> 
<li>Do they enjoy their work?</li> 
<li>What things do you think irritate them?</li> 
<li>What might be the question the net maker doesn't want me to ask?</li> 
<li>How would I ask that question in the most challenging or difficult way?</li> 
<li>What might he say?</li> 
<li>Shall we try it out and see what happens?</li> 
</ul>

<p>There is a mix of open and closed questions and they don't move from closed to open but are mixed in to achieve different goals for the drama and the learning. The questions require different styles of answering too. Some answers are through showing still images, others through voices in the head. It could be they answered through day&#8211;in&#8211;the&#8211;life conventions or a small improvisation.</p>

<p>As to strands and questions, yes, there are quite distinct questions for each strand. for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>So the net makers walk slowly in the morning carrying their nets to the beach, can you show me how that looks? (PK)</li> 
<li>Can you think of ways the net makers might show they are weary and anxious at the same time as they go to work? (DI)</li> 
<li>What did the net makers do that showed they were tired and weary? (CI)</li> 
<li>What else might work to show that? (CI)</li> 
<li>Who looked the weariest and why? (CI)</li> 
<li>Have you seen actors on TV look tired and what things do they do to show that? (UC)</li>
</ul>

<p><i>I find reflection and questioning leads to inspiration</i></p>

<p><b>Wayne:</b><br>
To me a crucial stage in drama and all art forms is 'reflection' and the questions posed during reflection can lead to blinding flashes of inspiration. These are moments of solitude and do not have to be shared with others. Often they may be linked to inquiry questions. For example, when studying a unit on 'Harry Potter' an inquiry question may be, 'How can we find the magic in our lives?' Drama activities would then be planned around this question, thus giving a context to work within and teach the strands, elements, conventions, techniques etc. Open-ended questions throughout will aid in developing character, plot, tension, focus etc. I use open journals displayed around the room that children add to whenever a question arises (A3 sheets of paper). They also write private questions in their own journals. They answer questions whenever they want.  Reflection occurs throughout with a final reflection at the close, pondering any answers gleaned or future directions to take.</p>

<p><b>Tim:</b><br>
I understand from your reply that you are using the 'tool' of questioning to help children unpack and explain the role in your illustration. You are addressing all four strands in this process and use both open and closed questions AND that this is done through using a range of conventions, is that right? It seems to me that the 'uniqueness' of drama questioning may lie in the use of drama conventions in conjunction with oral questions to help children to better understand what they are doing. How would you see the questions that you outlined above being different from those used in a discipline such as dance or music?
</p>

<p><i>A look at Eisner's principles and the need for private reflection to questions before sharing them</i></p>

<p><b>Gin:</b><br>
A few random thoughts come to mind. The first is two of Eisner's eight principles of arts learning &#8211; an 'awareness of multiple solutions' and 'imagination as a source of content.' I love these concepts and I have gathered this together in my work with students to mean that we are always looking for a 'what else could this mean?' or for example from within a drama I worked with this morning... 'Is there another person in this village who has a different opinion?' Not always to drive the drama forward but to allow time for all participants to explore and share their own thinking. As students become more aware of multiple solutions I think they start looking for wider possibilities. I think that the questioning strategies used in drama have a strong connection to the class culture of what is valued. Is thinking valued? How is value shown? Perhaps the challenge is to find ways within the drama for people to explore their own thinking before sharing with others &#8211; although this doesn't always keep drama in the moment.</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b><br>
When considering Eisner's 'lessons the arts teach' below, it's clear that enabling questioning strategies need to be used to help children to find these multiple solutions and perspectives, that Eisner talks about and to recognise that there are many forms of understanding.</p>

<p>Ten Lessons The Arts Teach, Elliot Eisner (Professor of Education, Stanford University)</p>

<ol>
<li>The arts teach children to make good judgements about qualitative relationships. Unlike much of the curriculum in which correct answers and rules prevail, in the arts, it is judgement rather than rules that prevail.</li> 
<li>The arts teach children that problems can have more than one solution and that questions can have more than one answer.</li> 
<li>The arts celebrate multiple perspectives. One of their large lessons is that there are many ways to see and interpret the world.</li> 
<li>The arts teach children that in complex forms of problem solving, purposes are seldom fixed, but change with circumstance and opportunity. Learning in the arts requires the ability and willingness to surrender to the unanticipated possibilities of the work as it unfolds.</li> 
<li>The arts make vivid the fact that words do not, in their literal form or number, exhaust what we can know. The limits of our language do not define the limits of our cognition.</li> 
<li>The arts teach students that small differences can have large effects. The arts traffic in subtleties.</li> 
<li>The arts teach students to think through and within material. All art forms employ some means through which images become real.</li> 
<li>The arts help children learn to say what cannot be said. When children are invited to disclose what a work of art helps them feel, they must reach into their poetic capacities to find the words that will do the job.</li> 
<li>The arts enable us to have experience we can have from no other source and through such experience to discover the range and variety of what we are capable of feeling.</li> 
<li>The arts' position in the school curriculum symbolises to the young what adults believe is important.</li>
</ol>

<p><i>How do other questioning tools fit into a drama classroom?</i></p>

<p><b>Phil:</b><br>
How does questioning tools such as: Weiderhold's Question Matrix, Bloom's Taxonomy of Thinking, the Divergent Questioning Model, De Bono's Six Thinking Hats and the Thinker's Keys fit into the work done in the drama classroom?</p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b><br>
I guess, like you, I see that the world has moved beyond Bloom's taxonomy. I find myself going to the work of Morgan and Saxton whose taxonomy of questioning is developed in their seminal Teaching Questioning and Learning text published by Routledge in 1991. Rather than asking what type of questions should I ask, they start with the question "What do I want this question to do?" Their classification system is similar to the ones you have mentioned and yet quite specific to the drama case. For example the basic classification is by general function. The questions, which elicit understanding, and those that elicit information are quite standard across curriculum areas, it's when they talk of the reflective question and how and why it is asked that we have a difference. Drama operates through a process referred to by Boal as metaxis, simply it means that when we are in role we are always ourselves and at the same time acting as some one else. We are spectators of our own action. This by its nature is a reflective process. We don't do drama to walk in others shoes to know about others but we do it so that we might have a sense of how and what we might do in a similar situation. Questions in drama press for reflection then work within this unique displacement of self in the other. It's why the drama reflective question is unique and more powerful (I would argue) than in other curriculum area, it is based on a lived reflective process itself. Action reflection cycles define practice in the arts and learning but what is quite unique about drama is that the action is active reflection in itself, on which we can then reflect. I am also aware that good questions are shaped by the quality of how we ask the question. Dorothy Heathcote reminds us that we wait on average less than a second for an answer in a classroom before we reshape it and ask it again if we don't get answers after an appropriate length of time. The silence can be scary but it's worth it. Actually I think the most powerful classroom questions are silences and pauses and the speculative "I wonder if..."</p>

<p><i>Summary</i></p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b><br>
Below find a summary of Peter's key points about the uniqueness of drama questions:</p> 

<ol>
<li>Rather than asking what type of questions should I ask, we (drama teachers) find it more useful to ask ourselves "What do I want this question to do?"</li> 
<li>In this process we are spectators of our own action.</li> 
<li>We don't participate in drama to walk in others shoes and to know about others, but we do it so that we might have a sense of how and what we might do in a similar situation.</li> 
<li>Action reflection cycles define practice in the arts and learning, but what is unique about drama, is that the action is active reflection in itself, on which we can then reflect.</li>
