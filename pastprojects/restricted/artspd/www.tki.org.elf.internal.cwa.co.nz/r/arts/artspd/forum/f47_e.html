   <h2 class="h2-forum">Exploring Pasifika education and the arts</h2>
      <p>Edited from forum discussion with <strong>Dr Airini</strong> (General 
        Manager, Pasifika Development, Auckland College of Education), 29 October 
        2003</p>
   <p><a href="index_e.html">Back to Archived Forum Discussion index</a></p>
   <h3>Introductions</h3>
   <p><strong>Sarah Wilson:</strong>
	<br />
	Dr Airini's responsibilities as General Manager of Pasifika Development focus on three key result areas: 
   <ul class="flush">
	<li>increasing participation, achievement, retention of Pasifika students at College</li>
	<li>ensuring every graduate of College is an effective professional when working with Pasifika peoples and materials</li>
	<li>pursuing enterprise opportunities in Pasifika education nationally and internationally.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Airini's teaching career started in primary teaching and has included education and business research, as well as tertiary educator roles in teacher education and education nationally and internationally. Before coming to her position with the College, Airini worked most recently in the Ministry of Education's national office as Senior Policy Analyst. Responsibilities included Pasifika education policy development specifically in the literacy and numeracy strategy policy, increasing participation in ECE and raising achievement in Pasifika education; and the Arts curriculum. Her current research activities include literacy education, mental health, and business development. </p>

   <br />
   It brings me great joy to share educational materials to enhance learning opportunities for Pasifika students.

   <strong>Teanau Tuiono:</strong>
   <br />
   Kia orana. I am a Cook Islander from the island of Atiu. Currently, I am Pasifika Editor for Te Kete Ipurangi &#8211; the Online Learning centre. Part of my role is searching the internet for sites that support the curriculum. The internet has great potential for Pacific peoples. It is about communicating, interacting, and sharing resources. The more Pacific content and Pacific peoples online &#8211; especially within the Pasifika education community &#8211; the greater the sharing of sparse resources and innovative ideas, ultimately benefiting our community.

   <h2 class="h2-forum">Forum discussion</h2>
   <p></p>
   <strong>Carol Langton:</strong>
   <br />
   Kia orana, Fakaalofa lahi atu, Taloha ni, Talofa lava, Malo e lelei Greetings to you all and welcome to the forum discussion today.
   <h3>Topic: Teaching Pasifika students</h3>
   <strong>Carol:</strong>
   <br />
   I have a question to begin with: 
   <br />
   With the increasing numbers of Pacific Island children coming to schools all around New Zealand &#8211; at the Arts hui, Dr Airini showed us some amazing statistics about this increasing roll for the future &#8211; what are some of the issues for teachers? How can we prepare our teachers?
   <p></p>
   <strong>Pale:</strong>
   <br />
   Talofa Everyone
   <br />
   An answer to Carol's question: Briefly (and Airini might have more to say) the issues for me are the support and human resource element that needs to be in place within the institution that teachers find themselves in. This can often affect the innovations that teachers provide in order to be an effective teacher in the classroom.
	
   <p></p>
   <p><strong>Airini:</strong>
	<br />
	Thanks for your words, Carol. You know, I figure the first way to prepare is to be aware. The stats and graphs help us to do that. This is a time for nation building, and teachers play a vital role in that.
	<br />
	<br />
	Someone I work with called Shane Ta'ala said the other day that what's needed is for all of us to understand the terms of engagement &#8211; which we begin by building trust based on commonalities &#8211; a lot of our efforts are based on infrastructure and systems, but (he says) we have missed the terms of engagement.
	<br />
	<br />
	What Shane is saying is that fundamentally we need to be attentive as educators &#8211; no assumptions, but plenty of attention to what the student actually needs. He says it is all about relationship building.
	<br />
	<br />
	As a former primary school teacher, I like to take that a step or two further along the practicalities pathway as well. In practical terms, getting ready can mean:
   <ul>
	<li>seeking out cultural mentors to advise my own practice</li>
	<li>establishing strong links between home and school</li>
	<li>being open to language and cultural diversity.</li>
   </ul>
   </p>
   And, in terms of learning in schools, it also means staying focused on achievement in the New Zealand curriculum.
   <br />
   <br />
   Here's a thought: With achievement in mind &#8211; and remember we are talking about over 60% of Pasifika children in New Zealand being NZ&#8211;born &#8211; how far down the culture track should Arts educators go? 
	
   <p></p>
   <strong>Carol Langton:</strong>
   <br />
	Thank you Airini for your in-depth and fine answer to my query. 
	   
   <div align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17"  border="0" alt="Back to top" /></a></div>
   <h3>Topic: Different approaches to learning</h3>
   <strong>Carol Langton:</strong>
   <br />
   I know this sounds philosophically large, but what are the different approaches to learning amongst the Pasifika teachers and the palangi way of looking at education? Mere? Pale?
   <p></p>
   <strong>Pale:</strong>
   <br />
   Are you meaning pedagogy that speaks of other factors that influence good Pasifika perspectives? What are the ones that you are familiar with so that I don't double up on what you know? 
	
   <p></p>
   <strong>Airini:</strong>
   <br />
	I'm wondering if your thinking is about learning styles and such like? If so, there's a really interesting commentary on that (and the serious problems attached to learning styles) in Adrienne Alton-Lee's (2003) <em>Best evidence for quality teaching with diverse learners</em>. That's an amazing read &#8211; available on the MOE's website.
   <br />
   <br />
	Adrienne cites 10 interrelated characteristics of quality teaching &#8211; things like being explicit about the learning expectations, and connecting the home and school cultural contexts for facilitating learning. 
	
   <p></p>
   <strong>Carol Langton:</strong>
   <br />
	Yes, I was thinking about learning styles and have read the Adrienne Alton-Lee report. I was also thinking of expectations, and what your colleague [Shane Ta'ala] called the "terms of engagement" between policy makers and educators and community and, again, expectations of achievement. 
	
   <p></p>
   <strong>Arini:</strong>
	If we are going each make a contribution to student success then we have to get our first principles sorted out. What I read between your lines is that we need to operate on the basis of inter-dependence rather than independence only. This means that policy making, syndicate planning and paint mixing can actually be part of the same 'big plan' for all students to be succeed. Fantastic huh! And maybe just the thing to keep in mind when working after school on clearing up, marking, and prepping for the next day.
   <br />
	Your work connects with my work.

   <h3>Topic: Pasifika and The Arts</h3>
   <strong> Carol Langton:</strong>
   <br />
  I have been to both Fiji and the Samoa during the 1970s and enjoyed many months of being taught music and dance... But when I arrived in NZ, I felt a certain lack of the arts in the culture &#8211; that one had to go to theatres, museums, galleries, shows, to see and hear the arts. In the islands, the arts are lived everyday. Is this difference also apparent in the schools?
	
   <p></p>
   <strong>Arini:</strong>
   <br />
	Guru Shane says that too many brown people have to leave their culture at the door of the classroom. I don't think he means that everyone should doing the siva all day, but it's the 'thing' that's too often missing &#8211; teachers being genuinely confident and pleased to be in a classroom working with diverse students. But that can also mean being willing to step outside one's own cultural expectations. Sounds like you know about this though Carol, seeing as you have read about the <em>Best evidence work</em> [Adrienne Alton-Lee, 2003] &#8211; Graham Nuthall is quoted in there on this issue of mediating between the culture of the teacher and the culture of the student.
   
   <div align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17"  border="0" alt="Back to top" /></a></div>
   <h3>Topic: 'Soul in education' conference</h3>
   <strong>Tom Evans:</strong>
   <br />
   I recently attended a conference in Australia the focus of which was 'Soul in Education'. Presenters from all over the world talked and demonstrated ways of engaging the soul or spirit of a learner without invading or colonising their culture.
   <br />
   <br />
   We pay lip service to the needs of the individual but far too often the institutions and our own cultural mores get in the way. Have the courage to risk adventuring into the unknown. As a Celt, while I know a great deal about the spirit of the culture, my knowledge of the everyday details are limited. We have very few Pacifica children here in South Taranaki but it does not prevent me from exploring the rich symbols available. It is fitting it into the needs of my students at their age and stage that is the real art for me.
	
   <p></p>
   <p><strong>Arini:</strong>
	<br />
	Hi Tom.
	<br />
	You're spot on. There are things we can each do though &#8211; for example:
   <ul>
	<li>teacher talk can include 'we' rather than 'them'</li>
	<li>teacher pedagogy can include the pause &#8211; did you know that if you ask a question and wait 5 seconds you can expect a 300&#8211;700% increase in length of reply, from the student?</li>
	<li>[learning can] include artefacts, language, music, community folks. All these things are possible.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
	I think the thing that is truly exciting nowadays is seeing resources and lessons in Pasifika arts relating to what it means to be a Pasifika person in Aotearoa New Zealand. It's a more realistic 'take' &#8211; without denying heritage.....
	<p></p>
	<strong>Sarah:</strong><br />
	Hi Tom.<br />
	That sounds like a wonderful conference! Is there a website or any conference notes that we could link to for more information?
	<p></p>
	<strong>Tom:</strong><br />
	There is a website 'Spirit of Learning', and a contact couple &#8211; Steve and Jenny &#8211; on <a href="mailto:parenteaus@mullum.com.au">parenteaus@mullum.com.au</a>. I recently had a very interesting newsletter from <a href="mailto:jade@creatrix.com.au">jade@creatrix.com.au</a>, Youth Newz.<br /><br />
	At the moment I am receiving e mails from all over the world discussing the implications of the conference. The concept of 'soul' in education is becoming a buzz word but the 'spirit' could be missing. The people I met with have been committed to these concepts for many years. They reminded me about were I am at with my teaching practice and attitudes. As I mix with people of other cultures, I am becoming acutely aware of the cultural needs of those in the community who are like myself and my children. We all need to grow our culture whoever we are.

   <h3>Topics: Resources request &#8211; Pasifika and the arts</h3>
   <strong>Sheryll:</strong><br />
   I am a teacher looking after the arts in my school and would like to start gathering resources for a Pasifika festival unit. Can you suggest where I should go for these? 
	<p></p>
	<strong>Teanau Tuiono:</strong><br />
	Here is a search string which, when you click it, it will bring up a number of resources which are Pasifika focussed in some sense and touch on the arts <a href="http://www.tki.org.nz/e/search/retrieve_search.php?element_array_data=DC.Subject.Keyword%3A%3A1834">http://www.tki.org.nz/e/search/retrieve_search.php?element_array_data=DC.Subject.Keyword%3A%3A1834</a>
	<p></p>
	<strong>Carol Langton:</strong><br />
	I am sitting in front of a beautiful piece of tapa cloth. It inspires me today.
	<p></p>
	<strong>Tom Evans:</strong><br />
	I use a great deal of tapa designs with our intermediate kids. I would like more ideas to use to extend the kids exposure to Island arts. The kids enjoy working with the tapa designs.
	<p></p>
	<strong>Teanau Tuiono:</strong><br />
	Have you seen this resource? It is called Digital Tapa:<br />
	<ul>
		<strong>Digital Tapa</strong> <a href="http://www.tki.org.nz/r/ict/ictpd/digital_tapa_e.php">http://www.tki.org.nz/r/ict/ictpd/digital_tapa_e.php</a><br />
		Purpose: For students to use drawing and publishing software to create a digital tapa, and in the process:
		<ol>
		<li>develop an understanding of tapa as a cultural artefact that tells a story and belongs to a particular place</li>
		<li>explore geometrical aspects of tapa, in particular, reflection, rotation, and translation.</li>
		</ol>
	</ul>
	<strong>Carol Langton:</strong><br />
	I have just looked at the Digital Tapa site &#8211; really good.<br />
	Also looked at the <strong>Pacific Culture</strong> site <a href="http://www.tbi.co.nz/new.php?topic=62">http://www.tbi.co.nz/new.php?topic=62</a> that Sarah posted earlier. That also is excellent.

	<h3>Topic: Pasifika resources being developed by MoE</h3>
	<strong>Mere:</strong><br />
	Currently we are looking at developing an online digital legends site and eventually weaving it towards sculpture lessons. What do you think? Are we on the right track for Pasifika?
	<p></p>
	<strong>Sheryll:</strong><br />
	This initiative sounds really exciting to me Mere. When will it be available?
	<p></p>
	<strong>Mere:</strong><br />
	At the moment the online digital legends site is in development and probably will be available by June 2004. Also there is a fantastic Pasifika Visual Arts book being developed with teachers notes which really brings together the traditional and the modern. It will be developed by June 2004 &#8211; all to support Pasifika in the arts.

	2004 seems a long time to wait but I guess these resources take time. All of them so far are excellent.

   <h3>Topic: Pasifika and dance</h3>
   <strong>Sheryll:</strong><br />
   I like the idea of bringing together the traditional and the modern [in dance]. When we teach kids dance in high schools, the boys really don't want to try very hard &#8211; but they love dancing modern hiphop and dancing with their friends. Does anyone have anything to say about this problem that could help us?

	<strong>Pale:</strong><br />
	Some of our teachers here have tried asking the children and young people in the school, and then engaging with some church members in the community.

	<strong>Sarah Wilson:</strong><br />
	A student recently made a great short film called Alisa &#8211; about a play being toured by Pacific Underground &#8211; about this idea. [It explores issues of bullying, cultural identity, hip hop, and contemporary versus traditional customs and values.] You can see it on TKI as part of a collection of work that high school students did to cover the Youth Arts Festival. You can see it at: <a href="http://www.tki.org.nz/r/arts/student_gallery/youth_arts_2003/poko/index_e.php">http://www.tki.org.nz/r/arts/student_gallery/youth_arts_2003/poko/index_e.php</a>. Your students might enjoy watching this for inspiration.

   <h3>Topic: Teanau's role on TKI</h3>
   <strong>Sheryll:</strong><br />
   Question for Teanau &#8211; as Pasifika 'Online Editor for TKI, what is it you do?
	<p></p>
	<strong>Teanau:</strong><br />
	I am the Online editor for the Pasifika community on TKI. It is the newest community with currently only one of the languages in curriculum form &#8211; Samoan. Cook Islands Maori curriculum is in draft, and the Niuean curriculum is currently being developed.<br /><br />
	I see my role as having an advocacy dimension to it, because a lot of the curriculum areas touch on Pasifika education. The classic example being The Arts.<br /><br />
	Another part of my role is finding Pasifika resources online that support the curriculum in some way. This is quite difficult because there are very few Pacific Nations sites that are in Pasifika languages or are appropriate for schools.<br /><br />
	I am also the Online Editor for the Maori Community, so the dealing with the sparseness of resources is not new for me, but it is different for Pasifika because there are a diverse number of communities which fit under the umbrella term Pasifika.
