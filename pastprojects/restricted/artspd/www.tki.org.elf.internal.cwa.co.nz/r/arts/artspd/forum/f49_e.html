      <h3><br>
        Introduction</h3>
      <p><strong>Sarah Wilson:</strong><br>
        This week we are un-wrapping the latest collection of New Zealand Curriculum 
        Exemplars for The Arts. </p>
      <p>The new arts exemplars have been distributed to your school and are also 
        now online at <a href="http://www.tki.org.elf.internal.cwa.co.nz/r/assessment/exemplars/arts/index_e.php">http://www.tki.org.nz/r/assessment/exemplars/arts/index_e.php 
        </a> </p>
      <p>The exemplars are samples of authentic student work annotated to illustrate 
        learning, achievement, and quality in relation to levels 1&#8211;5 of 
        The Arts in the New Zealand Curriculum. </p>
      <p>This will be a great opportunity to explore ideas with others from The 
        Arts Online community about how to make the most of this rich collection 
        of exemplars in your classrooms. </p>
      <p>Joining us online is <strong>Tracey McLennan</strong>, Senior Project 
        Officer for Teacher and Leadership Capability for the Ministry of Education.</p>
      <h3><br>
        Background information</h3>
      <p><strong>Sarah Wilson:</strong><br>
        What is an arts exemplar? <br>
        The purposes of the arts exemplars are to:
        <ul>
		<li>illustrate key features of learning, achievement, and quality at different 
        stages of student development<br></li>
        <li>help students and teachers to identify the next learning steps<br></li>
        <li>guide teachers in their interpretation of curriculum levels. </li></p>
		</ul>
      <p><strong>Availability of the arts exemplars</strong><br />
	  The arts exemplars materials are available in three formats: 
     <ul>  
	 <li> print</li>
       <li> online</li>
        <li> two CD-ROMs. </li>
	</ul> 
      In all of the dance, drama, and music exemplars, and some of the visual 
        arts, video clips have been used to capture important sequences during 
        the students&#8217; work over a period of time, as well as those elements, 
        such as performing movement or singing, which cannot be displayed in a 
        static image. </p>
      <p>To give teachers maximum access to video clips, the arts exemplar materials 
        are being provided on two CD-ROMs (in a dual high-impact case), as well 
        as online. Note that It is essential to view the video clips on the CD-ROMs 
        or online when working with the print materials for drama, dance, and 
        music.</p>
      <p>A pack, which includes the arts exemplars print materials and CD-ROMs, 
        has now been sent to your school and the online resources were made live 
        on the 1st November at <a href="http://www.tki.org.nz/r/assessment/exemplars/arts/index_e.php%20">http://www.tki.org.nz/r/assessment/exemplars/arts/index_e.php</a> 
      </p>
      <p>If you haven&#8217;t seen a copy of the resource yet make sure you track 
        it down! The materials are wonderfully rich and quite inspirational.</p>

      <h3>Forum discussion</h3>
      <p><strong>Simon Chiaroni:</strong><br>
        Hi, I'm Simon Chiaroni, arts publisher at Learning Media. I worked a lot 
        on the arts exemplars that you have in print form, so I am interested 
        to hear your responses to the exemplars, answer any questions you have, 
        ask some questions of my own.</p>
      <p><strong>Carol Langton:</strong><br>
        Kia ora koutou. Welcome to Tracy, and to Simon!</p>
      <p>I would first of all like to say that the Ministry of Education, the 
        five National Coordinators, and Learning Media have all done a tremendous 
        job getting these exemplars funded, created and published... to a very 
        high standard. Thank you on behalf of all the busy and delighted teachers.</p>
      <p><strong>Tracey McLennan:</strong><br>
        It is great to be on here representing the Ministry of Education. 'Thanks 
        for the thanks' on behalf of Camilla Highfield, the National Co-ordinators 
        and the rest of the team who were responsible for putting the exemplars 
        together. A huge amount of work did go in, and now we get to enjoy all 
        the wonderful work that will arise out of this. Great!</p>
      <p><strong>Tom Evans:</strong><br>
        Hi All! I am not able to stay online for long, however I would also like 
        to express my thanks for the visual arts exemplars. I will be using the 
        CD version next week at our teachers&#8217; only day to highlight the 
        resources available to teachers in TKI for the arts in particular.</p>
      <p><strong>Tracey McLennan:</strong><br>
        Thanks Tom! I know that Ann Brodie will love to gratefully receive your 
        thanks &#8211; the exemplars were not birthed without their moments, I 
        think it would be fair to say!</p>

      <h3>Topic: Exemplars and &#8216;Unwrapping the arts&#8217; units</h3>
      <p><strong>Angela:</strong><br>
        I teach drama from year 9&#8211;11 at Stratford High School. I have had 
        a good look at the exemplars and they look very useful. Will we be getting 
        any drama exemplars at level 5? </p>
      <p><strong>Simon Chiaroni:</strong><br>
        In answer to your question, Angela, yes, there is a level 5 exemplar being 
        worked on at present. The topic is Parihaka, and it's hoped it'll be sent 
        out to schools and up on the Web early next year.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Angela:</strong><br>
        Sounds great, especially a resource based on life under our wonderful 
        old mountain! </p>
      <p>It would be great if the exemplar idea was extended to cover the sample 
        tasks/units included in the 'unwrapping the arts' material on TKI... any 
        thoughts? </p>
      <p><strong>Simon Chiaroni:</strong><br>
        I see the &#8216;Unwrapping the Arts&#8217; units having a different purpose 
        to the exemplars. The sample units are examples of teaching activities 
        that are analysed to show how they meet the curriculum aims, strands and 
        AOs [achievement objectives]... whereas the exemplars are examples of 
        students' work that are annotated to show and discuss the learning that's 
        taken place. So they are different, but closely related too! And there 
        will be lots of connections possible between the two.</p>
      <p><strong>Sarah Wilson:</strong><br>
        This idea of connections between the resources available on TKI is one 
        that will, I think, continue to develop as links between different resources, 
        collections, and complementary areas as they continue to be created.</p>
      <p><strong>Angela:</strong><br>
        Simon, I appreciate the differences between Unwrapping the Arts and the 
        exemplars... I just thought, after seeing the exemplars, that it might 
        be interesting to see the units taken one step further with trialling 
        and outcomes recorded. I know that the exemplars project is still growing 
        ... just a thought for the future.</p>
      <p><strong>Tracey McLennan:</strong><br>
        I think that the reason that the Arts is in such an exciting position 
        at the moment, is that we have such a rich array of resources at our finger-tips, 
        both in print and online media. As Simon points out, &#8216;The Arts Unwrapped&#8217; 
        is different to the exemplars and serves quite different purposes, but 
        seen as part of a package for teachers, they are very valuable. There 
        seems to be many different directions that we can point people in at the 
        moment.</p>

      <h3>Topic: Using exemplars for moderation of assessment</h3>
      <p><strong>Carol Langton:</strong><br>
        Greetings Angela! Nice to have you onboard. <br>
        When you look at the standard of the drama exemplars, do they help you 
        with the moderation of assessing your students' work?</p>
      <p><strong>Angela:</strong><br>
        To be honest, the level 4 exemplars were a little frightening... My year 
        9 students do not arrive at high school with the literacy to be able to 
        effectively reflect on their own or respond to others' performances as 
        indicated in these clips. These clips are VERY useful for moderating assessment 
        of students' work. I find using students reflections a very good teaching 
        tool as well. </p>
      <div align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17"  border="0" alt="Back to top" /></a></div>
      <h3>Topic: Exemplar formats</h3>
      <p><strong>Simon Chiaroni:</strong><br>
        I'm not sure how many are online here with us but, Angela and others, 
        I'm curious to know how you're finding the print vs CD-ROM vs Web versions 
        of the exemplars. Which are you using mainly when you're looking at them 
        or working with them? Which versions are most helpful for various ways 
        of working with them? Any thoughts?</p>
      <p><strong>Angela:</strong><br>
        As I have only been exploring at this stage, I am using the web (broadband 
        is a delight in this situation)... I have visions of attempting to use 
        the CD in class if appropriate next year.</p>
      <h3><br>
        Topic: Using exemplars for lower levels</h3>
      <p><strong>Angela:</strong><br>
        Even though there are no level 5 exemplars yet, I have still been able 
        to get some very useful information on learning contexts and how to link 
        assessment back to the curriculum from the lower levels &#8211; cheers!</p>
      <p><strong>Sarah Wilson:</strong><br>
        Hi Angela!<br>
        Can you expand or give us an example of how you have done this?</p>
      <p><strong>Angela:</strong><br>
        Very briefly ... e.g. the 'Busted' exemplar gives a good description of 
        the teaching and learning that occurred as well as the reflection. This, 
        along with the &#8216;progress indicators&#8217; has really helped me 
        to have stronger checkpoints for my assessment. Assessment of the devising 
        process tends to be very 'subjective' and this has helped me to make it 
        or 'objective'. </p>
      <div align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17"  border="0" alt="Back to top" /></a></div>
      <h3>Topic: Sharing exemplars with students</h3>
      <p><strong>Tracey McLennan:</strong><br>
        I would be interested in knowing if any of you have shared exemplars yet 
        with parents/students and what their response has been?</p>
      <p><strong>Shirley:</strong><br>
        I&#8217;ve been working with the exemplars recently with Carol, and looking 
        for ways to help teachers find the resources that they need so they can 
        implement our long-term planning. The exemplars have got really useful 
        annotation. It helps to read these and we like the modelling. It helps 
        our teachers to ask the right questions, to look for the teachable moment. 
        It helps us to speak meaningfully and help the student grow towards their 
        own expressive creativity. </p>
      <p>The work itself helps us to judge the levels we must try to reach. The 
        videos are fantastic and the instructions about using them are very clear. 
      </p>
      <p><strong>Simon Chiaroni:</strong><br>
        Thanks, Angela. One of the thoughts behind the exemplars is that teachers 
        will view them with students. Would you find it helpful do you think to 
        view and discuss the students' reflections in the level 4 exemplars with 
        your students? Or do you think that might be a bit intimidating or off-putting 
        for them? </p>
      <p><strong>Angela:</strong><br>
        Intimidating? No, I think quite the opposite. My students find it a real 
        confidence booster when they see other students doing stuff. It's not 
        just me telling them they can do it &#8211; I have evidence! </p>
      <p><strong>Simon Chiaroni:</strong><br>
        Thanks, Angela, I find that really heartening! Also, high (but realistic) 
        expectations from teachers are such an important component in students' 
        self-esteem and achievement. </p>
      <p><strong>Tracey McLennan:</strong><br>
        Good point here Simon. I'm a firm believer that sometimes students and 
        teachers need to step up to the mark and view material that may well be 
        beyond them at that present moment in time. Not to totally freak them 
        out, but to be used as a tool to show extension opportunities, &#8216;where 
        to from here&#8217;. In this respect the progression of clips are really 
        useful I think.</p>

      </div>
      <h3>Topic: Wider uses of exemplars</h3>
      <p><strong>Tracey McLennan:</strong><br>
        Does anyone see possibilities for using exemplars across other groups 
        such as parents, community groups, and school boards? Groups who perhaps 
        need to see what quality Arts teaching and student work looks like. </p>
      <p><strong>Carol Langton:</strong><br>
        I agree with you Tracey. When I was travelling around the country last 
        year to some of our more rural schools, some teachers were daunted by 
        the standards on the resource videos. When I went back to them online, 
        they said they tried it out and the kids loved it and DID step up to the 
        mark. Kids are just little time bombs of talent sometimes &#8211; waiting 
        for the right conditions to set them going. </p>
      <p><strong>Tracey McLennan:</strong><br>
        Absolutely Carol! never underestimate students&#8217; ability to observe 
        others involved in an activity and then take themselves to a new level. 
        Don't be overly worried that they may 'copy' some aspect of this viewed 
        work, as so much of what we do in the Arts relies on exactly this happening. 
      </p>
      <p><strong>Sarah Wilson:</strong><br>
        Shirley, it sounds like you have really started integrating the resources 
        into your planning &#8211; have you done this in collaboration with other 
        staff members? If so, have you led this yourself and how have you gone 
        about introducing these ideas to them? </p>
      <p><strong>Shirley:</strong><br>
        I am preparing these planning documents with Carol at the moment. The 
        school librarian has helped with resources as well as Cathy Gibbs, the 
        music adviser, with staff PD &#8211; she was great.</p>
      <p><br>
        Once I have it all drafted up, I will present it to the staff for comment 
        and then think of ways to do PD sessions with them so they can implement 
        the planning next year. </p>

      <h3>Topic: Managing arts resources across the school</h3>
      <p><strong>Sarah Wilson:</strong><br>
        Can we help out with an answer to this? Sue wasn't able to make it on 
        but has emailed me the following question: if you feedback I will contact 
        her tomorrow and make sure she can log in to read the answers </p>
      <p>&#8220;We had one question here which was, if all the school is doing 
        the same art strand, how can resources be managed effectively so they 
        can be utilised by all? Short of spending money, of course. </p>
      <p><strong>Tracey McLennan:</strong><br>
        It wouldn't be the ideal, I don't think, to have all the school working 
        in this way. At the same time, is it totally unavoidable? Even if the 
        progression was slightly out, i.e. one group ahead of the other, that 
        would certainly work better for resource sharing, as well as the excellent 
        peer-feedback that could also occur after lessons. We have much to learn 
        from each other, and it would be a shame if this could not be shared and 
        then feedback utilised to make shifts/changes.</p>
      <p><strong>Carol Langton:</strong><br>
        This is an excellent moment for the exemplars to walk in, stage right. 
        For planning purposes, there are no better or more accessible resource 
        along with the MOE resource packs for each discipline. </p>
      <p>As far as physical resources go, well, that is why a good overview is 
        necessary when planning for the year...stretching resources (everyone's 
        fair share) is vital to peace of mind for the staff. I always used to 
        start my music units with the making of percussive and stringed instruments 
        and then added a few really good instruments to the final ensemble. </p>
      <p>Innovation is the name of the game in a school where the resources are 
        thin on the ground. </p>
      <p><strong>Simon Chiaroni</strong>:<br>
        First of all, what a fantastic problem to have, so many users that the 
        arts resources are stretched!! </p>
      <p>I'm not sure of your schools' circumstances, but one possibility might 
        be team teaching, where each teacher prepares a module/activity based 
        on a particular resource and then works with different classes at different 
        times to teach it. Takes a bit of co-ordination, but the students get 
        to experience different teachers' approaches and a range of activities/units.</p>

      <h3>Topic: Resources from MOE not getting through</h3>
      <p><strong>Julie Lawson:</strong><br>
        Tena koutou. Sorry so late &#8211; server playing up again, so wont be 
        on for long. </p>
      <p>Dare I say it, but we can&#8217;t find our exemplar CDs etc, so yet to 
        view them! </p>
      <p>sound great from everyone&#8217;s comments. Congrats to all concerned.</p>
      <p><strong>Tracey McLennan:</strong><br>
        Lost resources! That still seems to be such an issue in schools doesn't 
        it, whereby teachers can't find the materials that we're sending out there! 
        What's the solution everyone?</p>
      <p><strong>Carol Langton:</strong><br>
        There are already a few arts teachers/curriculum managers who have told 
        me that the exemplar resources haven't made it into their hands. I suggest 
        they first go to see the school secretary who handles the mail, then their 
        school librarian... and then the principal, who may be going through them 
        (familiarising him/herself). Julie has told me before that she has her 
        mail delivered to her home because it often &quot;doesn't make it to the 
        school mail box&quot;. </p>
      <p>If the teacher goes through the process of trying to find the exemplars 
        and still comes up with nothing, what should they do?</p>
      <p><strong>Simon Chiaroni:</strong><br>
        A good question for me, as Learning Media manages the Ministry distribution 
        and warehouse. Most of the time it seems resources do turn up somewhere 
        in the school. They're generally addressed to the principal in the first 
        instance, so that's often where they're stalled. </p>
      <p>But if they are still untraceable after searching, then the school should 
        contact Customer Services at Learning Media for replacement copies. </p>

      <p><strong>Tracey McLennan:</strong><br>
        Thanks for all of your input everyone. I've enjoyed hearing what is happening 
        at the grass roots level, as its so important not to lose sight of all 
        this work you are doing. After all, that's why the exemplars were developed 
        in the first place, and in the variety of formats that they are finally 
        in.</p>
      <p><strong>Sarah Wilson:</strong><br>
        Thanks everyone for joining us today, and to Tracey and Simon for being 
        our guests!</p>
      <p>Until next time&#8230;<br>
        Ka kite<br>
