<h2 class="h2-forum">Dance &#8211; Sue Trainor</h2>

<p><a href="index_e.html">Back to Archived Forum Discussion index</a></p>

<p>Excerpts from forum discussion with Sue Trainor (Limbs Dance Company)<br>
30 October 2001</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b><br> 
Sue Trainor from Limbs Dance Company is our first Arts Celeb. Sue is looking forward to responding to your questions about dance, the Limbs Dance Company or the current work that is being done in the <i>Limbs Retrospective 2001</i>.</p> 

<p>We are delighted to have this opportunity to speak directly to one of our New Zealand dancers, so let's make the most of it!</p>

<p><b>Sue Cheesman:</b><br>
In the company's reviews, both present and in the past, there has been a selection of dance styles mentioned. Can you explain what these various styles are and how they have been used in the dance? </p>

<p><b>Sue Trainor:</b> <br>
I am not sure how to answer this question. If you are referring to Limbs, then yes, there were many different styles of dance used. Most of the dancers in the company were originally ballet trained and then were introduced to a variety of contemporary dance styles such as Cunningham, Limon, Martha Grahan, Paul Taylor, etcetera. We also did pieces that were jazz-based and even things like ballroom dancing.</p> 

<p><b>Virginia:</b> <br>
I am looking at the themes and ideas that Limbs Dance Company used in their work such as <i>Melting Moments</i>, <i>Shark Attack</i>, and <i>Girl U Want</i>. Do you think that these themes and ideas are still relevant for today's audience?  If so, would the dances be choreographed for these themes in the same way? </p>

<p><b>Sue Trainor: </b><br>
Having just seen those three dances performed in the Limbs Retrospective I think they are relevant to today's audience if only as a slice of musical history (<i>Girl U Want</i> and <i>Shark Attack</i>). <i>Melting Moments</i> is a classic piece which has definitely stood the test of time. It is a very sensuous piece of choreography which blends beautifully with the music and could be performed by any company anywhere in the world as it does not have a cultural stamp on it. Perhaps the only difference between now and when those dances were made is the tendency for dances to be longer. Music videos have taken over as a vehicle for dance and most live dance choreographers seem to prefer to make longer pieces. </p>

<p><b>Virginia:</b> <br>
As a dancer with this company, what do you think made the company so special that, 25 years after its debut, its best loved works are again being shown in Auckland and Wellington?</p>

<p><b>Sue Trainor:</b> <br>
I think Limbs was very dynamic, exciting and fun and because we were enjoying ourselves so much, it rubbed off on the audience. The company was prepared to perform anywhere for anyone, and as such, choreographed pieces that were very adaptable and accessible. Using the contemporary music of the time also helped. I also think that the dancers themselves were chosen, not just for their technical skill, but for their personalities and their commitment to dance.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Alister:</b><br>
I am teaching in a small rural school and we are trying to develop our students' understanding through dance. How do you think your experiences in dance has influenced the way you see and react to the world?
 </p> 

<p><b>Sue Trainor: </b><br>
One of the best things about dancing was touring New Zealand and other parts of the world.  We were very fortunate because we were taken care of by the locals and shown things that you would not see as a general tourist.</p> 

<p>Meeting a wide variety of very interesting people from all walks of life helped to broaden my view of the world. Experiencing other people's culture and heritage and communications through dance, when perhaps language was a barrier, was a great experience. </p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b><br> 
How does the work that your company performs relate to those of us who do not have much knowledge about dance but are keen to find ways to begin?</p>

<p><b>Sue Trainor:</b><br> 
If you are able to see the <i>Limbs Retrospective</i> tour then it should give you a taste of contemporary dance that is very accessible to anyone who has not seen a dance performance before.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Limbs does not exist as a company anymore, but there is another company called Footnote, based in Wellington, which specialises in performing for schools and introducing students to contemporary dance. </p>

<p><b>Linda: </b><br>
I am interested in children seeing and understanding dance as a form of communication. Do you think the appreciation of dance is as important as the performance of dance?</p>

<p><b>Sue Trainor:</b><br> 
I think it is very important to nurture an appreciation of dance in all its forms in young people in order to build an audience for dance when they are adults. Without an audience, dance companies cannot exist as was seen in the demise of Limbs in 1989.</p> 

<p><b>Tarnia:</b><br> 
Where can you find resources to teach dance to children to help them realise it is not all about boys and girls holding hands and doing folk dancing? (I know this is a type of dance that can be taught but I am after something a bit more modern.)  Also what kind of music do you use for your type of dance?</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Sue Trainor:</b> <br>
If you can get your hands on some dance videos at your local video store, for example, musicals like <i>West Side Story</i>, <i>Saturday Night Fever</i>, etecetera, plus they also have a variety of ballet videos such as the <i>Nutcracker</i>. The main library of your nearest city will have a selection of dance text books, and if all else fails, you could try calling the New Zealand School of Dance in Wellington or The Performing Arts School in Auckland to get a list of reference books.</p> 

<p>Any kind of music can be used as long as it evokes some kind of response in the teacher or choreographer. When I have taught children I have used a mixture of contemporary music and classical. The contemporary music is good because often they know it and it has a good beat that they can hear. </p>

<p>The classical music I use is things like <i>Peter and the Wolf</i> because the music is specifically written to conjure the image of an animal, and children can hear it in the music, and respond accordingly. </p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b><br> 
Dear Sue, on behalf of the schools and teachers who have participated in this forum, I would like to say a huge thank you for the time you have taken to respond to each of us.</p> 

<p>It must have been an exciting, dynamic, yet probably arduous, life to be a dancer with Limbs Dance company.</p> 

<p>Clearly audiences loved your infectious dance style, and if the company still existed, it would probably have travelled to many of the rural locations where many of our schools are situated. </p>

<p>Just as you have been able to travel the world through dance, this forum is helping bring the world to some of us. </p>

<p>We are delighted that you could be our first Arts Celeb.</p>
