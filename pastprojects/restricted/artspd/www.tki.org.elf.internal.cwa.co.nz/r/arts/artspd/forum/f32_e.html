<p>Excerpts from forum discussion with Tessa Gray (Teacher, Art Facilitator and Writer)<br>
21 August 2002
</p>

<p>
<b>Val Duthie:</b><br> 
Kia ora, welcome to the Computers in Art forum with Tessa Gray as guest online. Tessa is a teacher, art facilitator and writer of the book <i>Computers in Art: for everyday use in the classroom</i> (2001). For the past 18 months, Tessa has left her intermediate classroom in Tauranga to teach children and teachers new ways of using the computer. You may have met Tessa at one of the Apple conferences that have been held up and down the country! When Tessa worked in school, she worked with half classes of approximately 18 children in the art room at a time. She worked with one computer. Art was taught on a thematic basis and all other art activities were derived from a context of study, for example, faces, bikes, pets and flowers. Skills were taught in a variety of different mediums from observational drawing, printmaking, sculpture, painting, 3D construction, through to photography, computer-generated art and movie making. Whenever possible the computer was integrated with the art programme. The focus of this forum is 'How to get started in using computers in art in the classroom.'</p>

<p><i>How did you get started?</i></p>

<p><b>Tim:</b><br>
I'm interested in getting started with computers in art with my class. How much technical knowledge about computers did you have before you started making computer art?
</p>

<p><b>Tessa Gray:</b><br>
When I became the art specialist, I spent many, many nights becoming more familiar with the language of art, and the processes of art. When these were consolidated, I realised that it would be easy to transfer this knowledge over to computers, e.g. drawing could be done by hand, then scanned into the computer and alterations could be made by using colour brushes etc to achieve another look before printing out. But it still started with the traditional method of drawing.
</p>

<p>Then I thought about how collage could be used to place photos on top of each other to create computer collages for posters, advertising, etc. If text was combined with images (another traditional technique) but using new media, which is the computer. In this respect the computer is an artistic tool, an expensive one, but very effective. I had one computer, one colour printer, one colour scanner and a digital camera &#8211; all very expensive, but necessary to bring in original images, not to conflict with copyright. All in all, I tried new software all the time, especially at home. I asked the school to buy PhotoShop and I practised and practised this at home in my own time. I learnt how to draw and paint in Dabbler and once again, practised and practised heaps to find out what the programs could do before I taught the children.
</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Anne:</b><br>
I would like to know more about this.
</p> 

<p><b>Tessa Gray:</b><br>
When I spoke about collage work and illustrating on the computer, I was talking about two different traditional forms of art-making that can be used to recreate art on the computer. For example, with collage work, you can open and use a programme like PhotoShop to open up different images that you have either scanned into the computer or downloaded from cameras, etc. (lets say, camp photos for example). This program allows you to open up several different images. You can then select areas, cut, copy and paste into a blank file. This process can be repeated until several different images have been copied and pasted onto the blank file, which has now become your new image. In fact PhotoShop used terms like Image and Canvas. Each image is stored separately on top of one another so that they can be separately moved and altered (size, direction, shape, perspective, colour etc). Some images can be made to be more transparent than others are and text can be added as another layer. Filters such as Fresco, Watercolour, and Ink Outlines etc can also be added to change the overall effects of the image. All in all, this is digital collage. Drawing or illustrating in Dabbler or Painter 5 means that an image (photo or pencil sketch) is scanned or downloaded into the computer and used as the original under tracing paper. The whole image is redrawn on the computer using the mouse or a Wacom Tablet to show illustration or painting effects like oil paint, chalk, charcoal, crayon etc. Traditional elements and principles of design are used to complete the art works, using the computer as an artistic tool. Any of these images can then be used in logo design, graphic design, children's books, book covers, posters webpages and slideshows, etc. I hope this helps. It can be very hard to understand via text messages, and so it is advisable to look at books that can help you in this medium. 
</p>

<p><b>Tim:</b><br>
You seem to have done a lot of up-skilling in your own time to reach the stage of understanding that you now have about computers in art. Can you suggest an easier pathway for us, or do you think that the only way to increase knowledge about computers in art is to spend the time with the computer to become familiar &#8211; rather like learning to play an instrument... you simply have to put the time into it.
</p>

<p><b>Tessa Gray:</b><br>
Yes, I do think you need to do this for yourself, with a positive attitude, time, effort, etc., no-one else will hold your hand, encourage you, so it must come from the teacher. Ask your principal for support, put it into your appraisals, go to conferences, play at home, find others to play with.
</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>Which websites did you use with children?</i></p> 

<p><b>Jean:</b><br>
When you were working with the children in your intermediate classroom, which websites were you using with the children? Do you have a favourite one?
</p> 

<p><b>Tessa:</b><br>
I have completed a resource with 180 odd art and computer art-related websites, animations, galleries, virtual tours, art detective sites, free software, etc., for both children and teachers. You can email me for itat <a href="mailto:tgray@waikato.ac.nz">tgray@waikato.ac.nz</a>
</p>

<p><i>What methods/strategies did you use to maximise the use of a single computer?</i></p>

<p><b>Sue:</b><br>
I wonder if you could talk about the methods/strategies you used to maximise the use of the one computer in your computer art teaching. 
</p>

<p><b>Tessa Gray:</b><br>
In relation to the methods/strategies I used to maximise the use of the one computer in my classroom, I instructed one or two children at a time with a clear design brief. I allowed them to discover attributes about the software themselves, with the intention or outcome in mind. Once their work was complete (three lessons, often) they were able to pass this information onto the other children, (buddy systems, etc.) and through using cooperative learning strategies. They were year 7/8 children so no harm came to my computer or my hard drive.
</p>

<p><b>Win:</b><br>
How did you use virtual tours, art detective sites, etc. when working with only one computer?
</p>

<p><b>Tessa Gray:</b><br>
Sometimes, the children weren't on the computer. Sometimes we used the computer to investigate ideas and sometimes I used the computer as a teaching tool. We often forget to teach teachers to use this as an instructional tool. It is I.C.T, which stands for information gathering or retrieval and communication technology, which is communicating and presenting findings. We would download pictures from Van Gogh's gallery and print these off to use as artists' models. In reality, the children were on my computer before school, interval, lunchtime, and after school.  They told me it was the best computer in the school. It was the same as everyone else's computer, with a lot of the same software, but no-one had shown the children how to use it properly. No games were ever played on my computer &#8211; they were too busy.
</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>What is the minimum equipment and programs needed to create computer art?</i></p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b><br>
What would be the minimum equipment and programs that a teacher could work with to create a piece of computer art? I read in your book how your year 7 and year 8 students had mainly used Adobe Photoshop, Dabbler, 3D Design IT, KidPix, Apple Works, Movie Player, Sound Effects and QuickTime V.R. to create the illustrations. You created the images by using an Apple Mac 5500/225, colour scanner, a Sony digital camera and an Epson 800 colour printer. With this equipment you were able to scan images, create illustrations, manipulate images, work with filters, and layers, introduce logos, text and graphics, work with non-static images and more. Would someone need all of this equipment and programs to get underway?
</p>

<p><b>Tessa Gray:</b><br>
In relation to the amount of equipment and software, if you want quality, you have to pay for quality. Any graphics programmes are very expensive, but will last for many years. You need to think of it as I.C.T, language, visual literacy, social studies, maths and science, etc., and get money from those areas to support computers costs. You could start out with a digital camera and leave out the scanner, just photograph photographs, etc. You could also use the following software only, which I highly recommend: Kid Pix (for drawing, animations, slideshows), Hyperstudio (for drawing, animations, multimedia slideshows, sound), Photocell $400 for educational use (same as PhotoShop with filters etc for special picture effects).
</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b><br>
Can you tell us why this software has advantages? Is it readily available, free download, cheap, easy to use?</p>

<p><b>Tessa Gray:</b><br>
The software I have recommended is valuable because... <br>
1) Kidpix is cheap, it's about $20 from the Warehouse. It enables the children to create their own logos instead of using clipart. It has decent art tools and allows the children to animate, which is the best part of this technology. It takes us further than traditional means of art making and is one of the three processes mentioned in the arts curriculum Timed Based Media.<br>
2) Hyperstudio is awesome because it enables the children to have more power over their presentations than PowerPoint. It allows them to make roll-over buttons, animations, and sound, record their own sound, make their own story books, etc. <br>
3) Photodelux allows them to develop design graphic skills, layout, desktop presentation, combinations of text visuals, filters for special effects, logo design, art design, fashion design, advertising etc.</p>

<p><i>Barriers to using computers and things to think about and the need for a mentor</i></p>

<p><b>Tessa Gray:</b><br>
There are three main barriers to teaching using computers... 1) Not enough teacher knowledge of computers and programmes, 2) Not knowing how to transfer this knowledge onto the learner in a meaningful way, 3) Not enough time!!! And then there are the other issues... Only one computer... I solved this by thinking "one is better than none". I can't teach everyone. When a child misses a day at school do we panic? Then don't panic if a child is on the computer is doing something other than the other children, like maths, etc. Not enough technical knowledge... Work with an I.C.T specialist to help you.</p>

<p><b>Tessa Gray:</b><br>
Try to think about computer art as a fancy way of creating traditional art works... illustrated, photographed, collage, painted, etc., or movement for animations. Once you realise the potential for creating fashion design, logos, advertising posters, cards, children's books or images merely as art for art's sake, you then need to think about... What software do I need? How will I learn how to use it? Who can teach me? How much will this all cost? How can I get support for this in my school?</p>

<p><b>Raewyn:</b><br>
Did you have a mentor in the beginning? When you were getting underway in your school, who answered these questions for you? </p>

<p><b>Tessa Gray:</b><br>
This is a good question and a hard one to reply to. Sometimes, you just don't know why you know things, but I taught myself a lot. Back then I was having to convince my staff members that I needed the computer, because there was resistance, and I had to convince my bosses that I could use it. They didn't know what the potential was, so I looked around in the real world to see what they were using, how and why, e.g., in publishing houses, print shops etc. When the time came for me to justify what I wanted to do, I ran it past my boss and pitched it to the board and got funding.  The brilliant thing about computers is that it can up the profile of art when people think it is not a valuable area, but now computers... that's something else that means our children will be ready for the future... capitalise on that argument. The other questions I took to the I.C.T specialist in the school who dealt with the technical side of things. To this day, I cannot profess to know any technical workings of the computer. I was the only art specialist in the school, so I could justify my budgeting in this area. Once again, about upskilling myself, I played an awful lot, even though, I knew little to begin with, then begged everyone to let me go to conferences... part of my appraisal. What software do I need, How will I learn how to use it? Who can teach me? How much will this all cost?</p>

<p><i>Can a teacher with basic computer competencies work in computer art or are they program-specific?</i></p>

<p><b>Sue:</b><br>
Can a teacher with some basic computer competencies work in computer art or is it very programme specific. </p>

<p><b>Raewyn:</b><br>
Can you expand on this for us? You said that one of the barriers was: '2) Not knowing how to transfer this knowledge onto the learner in a meaningful way.'</p>

<p><b>Tessa Gray:</b><br>
Often teachers can learn the software, (and, yes, even those with the most basic knowledge can do this also, it just takes time and a good tutor to help you) and then know how to transfer this knowledge onto the learner, e.g., what creative processes do I want the children to develop, what is educationally sound, how does it fit into my other curriculum studies, what is artistically valuable? If art is a form of communication, then we should be using visual text more to communicate our findings in all other curriculum areas. Once a teacher knows the software, they then can transfer this over to the learner in a meaningful way.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>What about moving images?</i></p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b><br>
Everything we have discussed so far is about still images. What if we want the images to move?</p>

<p><b>Tessa Gray:</b><br>
That is a good question about images. Everything we talk about today will still be about images.  It is whether or not they are moving that make it Time-based art. This is simple. Animations can be made either as illustrated images repeated in sequence with slight variations or photographed 2D images made out of plasticine or clay etc that can be photographed with variations of movement and placed in sequence. Anyone can do this. You will need a digital camera and a slideshow programme like PowerPoint, hyper studio, Kidpix, etc., so that the images can be placed in sequence with no time between the transitions of frames to show movement.</p>

<p>Just to clarify the animation point, it is the digital version of a flipbook.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>What would you say to teachers for them to use it as an instructional tool?</i></p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b><br>
What would the main points be that you would want to say to teachers if you were to instruct them to use a computer as an instructional tool?</p>

<p><b>Tessa Gray:</b><br>
There are several art programmes, like Painter 5 by Fractional Design, that actually demonstrate how to teach painting (e.g. block in colour, over paint, add details and patterns last etc, this is shown in mini movies). There are several movies that can be downloaded from the websites I mentioned above, that give instructional lessons on how to animate things like logo. CD-ROMs with information about artists, styles, movements of work etc. And of course Internet sites with awesome pictures and information. For example, once we studied Claus Oldenburg and we wanted to make weird wild clay cakes, so we went onto the internet and typed in cake shops and got loads of ideas for our cakes, like trucks, rugby balls, hats, etc.</p>

<p>The thing about using the computer as an instructional tool is that with a large class you may need a large screen TV or data projector and these aren't cheap.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>How can we contact other schools in relation to computer art?</i></p>

<p><b>Jean:</b><br>
It would be good to link with other schools that are working with computers in art in New Zealand or overseas. Can you suggest a website or school that we could contact?</p>

<p><b>Tessa Gray:</b><br>
In terms of good schools using I.C.T., the primary schools I know of include Tawa Primary in Wellington, Glen Eden Intermediate in Auckland, Selwyn Ridge Primary in Tauranga, Te Akau ki Papa moa in Tauranga, Bellevue Primary in Tauranga. They are doing amazing things... And look out for the new time-based media exemplars from the Ministry of Education soon, which will inform you more about processes, applications, procedures and software, etc.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>Where is technology taking us?</i></p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b><br>
As you travel around the country you must see lots of interesting artwork done on computers.  Where do you see technology taking us to next in the art world?</p>

<p><b>Tessa Gray:</b><br>
I actually don't see that much art on computers. It is still very new and still very scary for a lot of teachers. But I believe we are totally in a visual culture in a visual world that relies heavily on the need for global communications with a need for speed. Visual literacy is the way ahead for all of us. It is a fast, effective way to communicate and allows the children to be kinaesthetic and hands-on with their application of knowledge. It allows them to consolidate learning for longer, instead of regurgitating text. Art is not just about aesthetics anymore. It is about combining text and visuals for everyday communication. We have oral language, text and visual language. I don't see the computer taking over our art world, but it is definitely part of it now. It shouldn't detract from our traditional art forms, merely enhance them in some way. Art is about doing things in a 100 different ways. Much like the early cave markings, this is our era for communication via symbols of shape and colour, etc.</p>
