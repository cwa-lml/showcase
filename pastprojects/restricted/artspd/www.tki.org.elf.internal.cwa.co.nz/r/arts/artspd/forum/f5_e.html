<p>Excerpts from forum discussion with Merryn Dunmill (National Coordinator &#8211; Music)<br>
19 September 2001</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b><br> 
Welcome to the second Arts Online forum. This week we are delighted to welcome Merryn Dunmill, National Coordinator for the Arts, as our special guest. Merryn has a wealth of experience in the field of music and a deep understanding of the Arts Curriculum statement. </p>

<p>The forum is focused on music trouble shooting. I'm looking forward to a lively session, so the earlier you post your questions the better. </p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill: </b><br>
Kia ora koutou. Merryn Dunmill here online today to share ideas about music teaching and learning in your school. Please feel free to ask any questions you've been burning to ask or not had any answers to. I may just be able to help!</p>

<p><b>Val: </b><br>
Are there some learning outcomes somewhere to give us direction to our programmes?</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill: </b><br>
Yes, Val, the new handbooks are on the way. The junior one, to be out at the end of the year, has learning outomes based around the achievement objectives for each which are, for example, singing, playing, listening, creating and responding, and moving. On TKI there are great units to use too and you can adapt these and develop your own specific learning outcomes to suit your students, resources and needs. These are all being updated and now include learning outcomes and assessment for music so watch for the changes to come (probably completed by start of next year at the latest). When you write your own learning outcomes they need to describe exactly what the student has learned, for example, for level 2 (PK) assessment outcomes you could have them: 
describe the tempo of four different pieces of music heard using the language of music (for example, fast, slow, faster, slower); demonstrate through approporiate movement changes to dynamics or draw symbolic representations of original musical ideas that reflect the classroom aquarium, etcetera. If you would like some specific help regarding a unit you are teaching I could help here and now or you could take your time and email me on <a href="mailto:merryn.dunmill@cce.ac.nz">merryn.dunmill@cce.ac.nz</a></p>

<p><b>Val:</b><br> 
Thanks for your very full answer. What do you suggest for the teacher who is not so musical (i.e. me)! I am very lucky, my release teacher takes music and does a great job, but I'm always keen to learn.</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b> <br> 
1. Believe in yourself! We are all musical because we are human. You can do it!<br>
2. Tackle what you know you and the students can achieve first, this makes everyone feel good.<br>
3. Look at the vast knowledge the students have and invite them to set goals on their learning too. This will help you decide on learning outcomes that best suit their needs which will be very different as there is always a huge range of ability and experience in any one class. 

<p>What instruments/resources do you have?</p>

<p><b>Val:</b><br> 
We have quite a lot of percussion instruments; each child has a recorder and there are enough glockenspiels for about one between two. What else do you think we need? We are a two-teacher school, which goes to year 8, although we have three teachers in the morning, allowing music to be taken with a smaller group at times in the morning.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill: </b><br>
It's good to have a range of quality untuned percussion to hit, for example, bongos, tambourines, claves, cow bells, even good old stones from the garden (Papa Tuanuku). These provide a range of contrasts in sounds and exploration opportunities. Paper and household stuff can be useful too. I think an electronic keyboard is essential for harmony work and you have all those nasty preset buttons for throwing in a rhythmic accompaniment when there is nothing else, this saves you doing it and you can vary the styles, for example, reggae one time, tango another, etcetera. Good listening gear is essential and maybe a listening post so children can opt into a listening station for time out or bonus, or focused listening exercises.</p>

<p><b>Val: </b><br>
What type of electronic keyboard would you suggest?</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b><br> 
Make sure it has a full keyboard range and if you have the money, be midi-capable so you can grow into using computer software such as <i>Junior Band in a Box</i> which gives backings in all sorts of styles, and is a composing tool and a performing tool too. Not hard to use and many primary schools use this version well. Roland and Yamaha are always reliable brands.</p>

<p><b>Val: </b><br>
Thanks for your help Merryn. How do you see the link with music and the other disciplines. Have you any ideas for music for dance?</p>

<p><b>Gill:</b><br> 
Hi Gill here. Checking in for the first time. I would like to know how to access excerpts of cultural music to use across the school from CDs any suggestions for suitable resources?</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill: </b><br>
There is a wealth of music of course in CD stores on world music but that is not always accessible for many reasons! <i>Music Around the World</i> by Peter Dunbar Hall has a tape and text for teachers which is great and can be adapted to suit any level. Quite expensive Australian kit at around $100 for the tape and book. <a href="http://www.learningmedia.co.nz/">Learning Media</a> &#8211; check out all their School Journal tapes as there is a bit on them and also the music resources for M&#257;ori and Pacific nations. Will get back in a tick with a great website too.</p>

<p>Found that web address for music of the world ... 
<a href="http://www.contemplator.com/folk.html">http://www.contemplator.com/folk.html</a> and that will lead you to lots more. A wee advertisement: check out the next issue of <i>Starters and Strategies</i> which will be in your schools soon as I have done a music page set around level 3 of the curriculum using <i>Kiwikidsongs 10</i> and the National Anthem CD sent free to schools last year, if you can locate it.</p>

<p><b>Sue:</b><br> 
Sue here, can't stop for long as I'm off to the Wearable Arts dress rehearsal so if the answer to my queston is posted after I log off, I'll catch up with it later. 
At present in the middle and upper school, our music programme for the latter two terms revolves around "Live Recorder" as this is "what has always been done"! I can play the recorder quite well but I find the programme really restricting and non-stimulating, but unfortunately, I don't have much of a choice, and to meet the demands of this programme, there is little or no time left to create etcetera. There will be big changes next year at school with a new principal, so do I just sit out this year so to speak? This doesn't really allow me to meet my contract requirements, though, although it does keep the peace at school! Help!</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b><br> 
Recorders! Mmm ... you can do some great games with even BAG! Make up a bingo game with combos of these letters or others to make words. They can be played as a listening game; you play, they play back the one they think it is. Make up their own as they get more notes under their fingers and gradually put in rhythm and pitch notation. Write short "tunes" on cards, for example, the beginnings of well known songs. Get them to finish them off, write them out. Put the cards in different orders so they are composing their own and playing them to others who then could try to transcribe and make up their own. Play pop songs and even choreograph them to give appeal. Try dynamics and lighting effects too, these work a treat. Also, listen to koauau music, for example, <i>Te Ku Te Whe</i> by Richard Nunns and Hirini Melbourne (CD) and make recreations of M&#257;ori music. Great video on M&#257;ori instruments available from <a href="http://www.learningmedia.co.nz/">Learning Media</a> is <i>Toi Puoro</i> which is gorgeous and a different approach to playing wind instruments like recorders. Good luck!</p>

<p>Dance and music work very well together and dual assessment can occur at junior levels where movement is the best way to respond to sound for wee ones. Culturally speaking, dance and music in most cultures of the world are inextricably woven together, for example, kapa haka. One discipline informs the other in these settings. Music certainly influences dance and dance needs music! It gets more difficult as you progess to higher levels as skills and knowledge bases become distinct and more complex. The UC strand is an area to explore shared understandings, for example, through the study of music and dance of the world, gypsy music (use <i>Latcho Drom</i> video) although this is better suited to the upper levels if you want to get into any depth.</p>

<p>Ka kite ano.  Well everyone, sorry but I have to go now. Look forward to chatting again on October 24th, same time same place. Have fun out there with your wonderful inspiring music programmes &#8211; the children will love you for it!</p>
