<p>Excerpts from forum discussion with Ann Brodie (National Co-ordinator &#8211; the Visual Arts)<br>
7 August 2002
</p>

<p>
<b>Val Duthie:</b><br> 
Kia ora, welcome to our visual arts forum with guest Ann Brodie (National Co-ordinator &#8211; the Visual Arts). The focus this week is on painting and the discussion will focus on "How to help students to look at art works with greater understanding and perception". Reference for this discussion will be pages 5&#8211;16 of <i>Painting &#8211; Exploring the Visual Arts in Years 1&#8211;6</i> booklet (the Ministry of Education resource that is in all schools). This week, your challenge is to search the web for a useful site about "reflective questioning strategies".</p>
<br>

<p><i>It is a great resource</i></p>

<p><b>Sheryl:</b><br>
Thanks for these great resources. I have really been enjoying teaching painting since following this book. I find it easy to use and it has given me a way to approach teaching that I didn't think of before. I find that we didn't spend enough time to really look at the paintings we have. I wasn't asking enough questions to start the kids looking at them properly. I should have used the how, what, where, when and why questions, but didn't really. I've been surprised at how easily my kids can speak about paintings now that we are all asking better questions. It's been challenging. We have agreed that there is no right or wrong answers, and I think that's been helpful.</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b><br>
I am delighted that you are having a richer questioning experience with your students. The 'no wrong answer' guideline is a really good way to start.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>How important is it that children understand the context of painting?</i></p>

<p><b>Kelli:</b><br>
How important is it that children understand the context of the painting?</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b><br>
The context is part of the discussion/knowledge only and certainly can be discovered through questioning.</p>

<p><b>Phil:</b><br>
I have just been looking at the <i>Eyes on Art</i> website and was really interested to read what they have to say about acquiring background knowledge about painting. They provide four main points: 1) provide a window into a few key works for elementary grades; 2) juxtapose paintings to promote seeing; 3) view both breadth (an array of images) and depth (one artist's work); 4) use a discipline-based arts education approach to developing a fuller appreciation. It also suggested that students repeatedly view and summarise works so that quality and connections can be made. Would you agree with this approach?</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b><br>
Those approaches could be useful at different times and for different purposes. You would wow beginners if you juxtaposed paintings as a starter, I think, but it could have its place as a mind opener. The use of looking to find out about artists' stylistic approaches is essential, and from level 4 in New Zealand we see that as important. The wide menu approach also enriches but not so much in relation to a practical task. A limited number of works by one or several artists (probably related but not necessarily) would be useful for a following in-depth practical response. Some countries do less original art making with their students and they do lots more finding out about artworks and artists, e.g. the UK, Australia and USA. In New Zealand we have a more child-centred approach. We ask them to respond to art works by making an original (you could say derivative) response. Although we do do CI/Understanding Context work just requiring thinking researching and responding and no making.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>How important is it that people develop higher thinking strategies?</i></p>

<p><b>Chris:</b><br>
I have been interested in strategies to develop higher order thinking skills and at the same have been looking at the role of reflective questioning in leadership. This has led me to a few sites, some of which I list here.<br> 
<a href="http://www.fbe.unsw.edu.au/learning/instructionaldesign/strategies.htm" target="_blank">http://www.fbe.unsw.edu.au/learning/instructionaldesign/strategies.htm</a><br> 
<a href="http://www.devco.demon.co.uk/Mirrormodel.html" target="_blank">http://www.devco.demon.co.uk/Mirrormodel.html</a><br>
<a href="http://iod.unh.edu/projects/leadership.html" target="_blank">http://iod.unh.edu/projects/leadership.html</a> </p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b><br>
How do you approach painting in your school? I know that you have been interested in strategies to develop higher order thinking skills for some time now, so it would be really good to hear how this has changed your practice and in what way.</p>

<p><b>Chris:</b><br>
Well, I thought outside the square and found a resource in my Principal-release teacher. I get her to look after visual arts (painting, drawing, construction, etc). For me I usually start with sketches and drawing. This might lead on to construction and then either paint or dye or both as another media. I like the idea that was shown me once by an art lecturer. He called it the "Creative Expressive Experience" in art. Take a poem, e.g. <i>The Gorse Fire</i> by Denis Glover, read it several times, have students act out the lines "a little spark growing higher and higher turning into a column of fire", "rushing and roaring". Finally they have an A2 sheet and a palette of paints to do a gorse fire. Hang about and I'll ask my resident expert.</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b><br>
Are you using reflective questioning strategies in class or de Bono's strategies, etc., in your teaching and what difference, if any, has that made? I know how challenging it is to learn effective questioning techniques and many schools are struggling to do this across all curriculum areas. It seems to me that this may be the key to helping children to analyse and interpret what we look at too.</p>

<p><b>Chris:</b><br>
The area is a bit new to me. I don't recall any classes at Training College about Blooms Taxonomy, Gardner or de Bono. I have been concerned, as I have expressed in the past, that we need to teach kids how to think not what to think. One approach is to use the P4C (Philosophy for Children) tools to engage them in discussion. However to use questions to challenge, guide and promote thinking is better for kids that are used to having it all handed to them on a plate. I am planning to use a de Bono task in a couple of days as a means to get the class to solve a problem. As I say, it is a new area for me. <a href="http://www.neat.tas.edu.au/HENT/world/rss/files/hats.htm" target="_blank">http://www.neat.tas.edu.au/HENT/world/rss/files/hats.htm</a>. Anyone else who can suggest resources and ideas feel free to contribute. "Together we learn".</p> 

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b><br>
Chris, check out these sites: <a href="http://fno.org/" target="_blank">http://fno.org/</a>, the information technology journal <i>From Now On</i>. This contains useful articles on student inquiry learning using ICT. Also "learning journeys" (web quests) that children can take across all subjects and years. These are accessible on <a href="http://webquest.sdsu.edu/matrix.html" target="_blank">http://webquest.sdsu.edu/matrix.html</a></p>

<p><b>Chris:</b><br>
Thanks Val, I have been a subscriber of Jamie Mackenzie for a few years now. I like his style. He makes a lot of sense with down-to-earth realism. His other site <a href="http://staffdevelop.org/" target="_blank">http://staffdevelop.org</a> is also very good.</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b><br>
Have you seen his homeport explorer model from Bellingham Schools: <a href="http://wwwsil.bham.wednet.edu/Curriculum/homeport.htm" target="_blank">http://wwwsil.bham.wednet.edu/Curriculum/homeport.htm</a>, useful model!</p> 

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>How do you channel class discussion to be meaningful and useful, using focus and questioning?</i></p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b><br>
During any class discussion about painting, the teacher will be able to collect a huge range of children's experiences, understandings and knowledge about paintings and painting techniques. How to deal with all of this? How do you channel all of this into a meaningful and useful experience for the class?</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b><br>
Of course there needs to be a focus that is clear and adhered to unless unexpected turns promise to be fruitful. Then good teachers capitalise and do a u-turn.</p>

<p>In addition, all the rich and varied responses can be processed 'on the hoof' by the teacher as they contribute to ongoing formative assessment. Heaven help us if a teacher felt the need to record all responses to questioning! I wanted to raise the issue of using art language and to ask people if they feel constrained by the initial lack of art vocabulary?</p>

<p>Have you noticed and appreciated how carefully and aptly the writer of the painting resource has sorted the questions into types? Also he has arranged these types into a series that begins with the least threatening and most obvious features, e.g., what can you see in the work? I think his order of questioning is really sensible as it builds in complexity.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>How to learn the vocabulary of art</i></p>

<p><b>Sheryl:</b><br>
It's sometimes difficult in class when we get confused because we don't all know the correct vocabulary to use. I'm trying to work on that at the moment and we are introducing one term everyday and pinning it on the class wall. We have a game about always using the correct term. Anyone who doesn't has the cleaning up to do! I liked the strategy that Merryn had in the music forum where the teacher always responded to a comment by using the correct term. That was a good way to model for children, I thought.</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b><br>
At the top end, art language can become unintelligible but that is in the realm of art criticism and art philosophy. Some reviews in the paper and especially <i>Art New Zealand</i> can be really unintelligible. Leading in with the questionings in Rob McGregor's book is safe. When the second type of questioning begins, i.e., the formal analysis, the teacher is introducing concepts along with language by following his guidance.</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b><br>
I think that one of the reasons teachers have reported a lack of confidence when asking questions in the arts (research Barry &amp; Townsend; Anderson; Eisner) is that they are unsure of the specific terms to use. In the curriculum statement, the glossaries that follow each discipline section are a very good place to start to learn these words. Are there other ways that teachers can learn the language of the arts, Ann?</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b><br>
I think the way to begin is not to fear one's lack of art vocabulary. The glossary is a really good place to start. Then, with practice, confidence grows and as one encounters websites, etc., such as those being aired on this forum and by Val in the newsletter one gains more language. At first the correct terms don't matter &#8211; they can be discovered/presented after. It is an ease with the process of responding to and interpreting an artwork that matters, making one's own meaning. Bad luck artist!</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b><br>
"It is an ease with the process of responding to and interpreting an art work that matters". I really like this sentence. Children are often very good at responding honestly and with some focus to an artwork. This initial engagement needs to be nurtured through sensible and open-ended discussion. It is so important for the teacher to listen to what the children are saying. Dialogue can then be extended to more challenging questions that bring about more in-depth responses and interpretations.</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b><br>
I am presently editing nine new TKI learning examples for <i>The Arts Unwrapped</i> and I have included formative questions more consciously in some of these.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>How much time do you need to give children to look at a painting?</i></p>

<p><b>Kelli:</b><br>
Research shows that we don't give children enough time to view. I was also wondering, how much time we should give children to look at a painting.</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b><br>
I think the time period is quite up to you but certainly don't take the first eager hands that go up as a signal for the class to stop looking. I would wait several minutes beyond that. Really the children will grow their awareness during the looking/responding period and they will be jogged to new awareness by their classmates' responses too. This means questions can organically keep arising as responses are formulated in response to pennies dropping.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>Ways of getting kids to enjoy painting</i></p>

<p><b>Jean:</b><br>
I'm finding this a useful resource too. I'm using the glossary to improve our vocabulary and also trying out some of the associated activities on page 11. I find that my class really enjoys role-play and detective work. They come back to the painting we are looking at and have so much more to contribute after that. Did anyone look at the detective website in Action Arts? My kids love it. If anyone has any other ways of helping kids to enjoy painting, I'd love to hear from them.</p>

<p><b>Ann Brodie:</b><br>
Fun getting the children to engage! Have you looked at the learning examples in the document and the exemplars and at <i>The Arts Unwrapped</i> for ideas, too? They need to have that same pleasure in a sequenced learning experience, too.</p>
