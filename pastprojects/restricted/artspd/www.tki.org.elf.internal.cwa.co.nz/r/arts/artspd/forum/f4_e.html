<h2 class="h2-forum">End of year activities</h2>

<p><a href="index_e.html">Back to Archived Forum Discussion index</a></p>

<p>Excerpts from forum discussion with Peter O'Connor (National Coordinator &#8211; Drama)<br>
23 November 2001</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b><br> 
Peter O'Connor, the National Coordinator for the Arts &#8211; Drama is our guest this week. 

The focus of this forum is to discuss and share ideas to help in the end of year drama activities you and your students will be participating in. </p>

<p><b>Jeanette:</b> <br>
What are some strategies for using drama to introduce a Christmas theme with years 1 and 2?</p>

<p><b>Phil:</b><br> 
I would really like to involve all of my class (15 children aged 8&#8211;9 years) in our Christmas activities at the end of term. I would like to find some new strategies so that each child has the opportunity to contribute to the meaning of Christmas from their own experiences. Can you suggest some strategies that I could explore so that our end of year activities have more meaning for my students? </p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor: </b><br> 
Some great questions to start the forum off. I have wonderful memories of my own days as a 5- or 6-year-old wearing either the tea towel around my head or a sheepskin rug over my back as we paraded in front of the manger. I also remember the exquisite joy of watching my own daughter go through the same rites of passage as a young child. So I'm not going to knock at one end the traditional ritual of a childrens Christmas performance. However at another level it is exactly about making it a more meaningful experience both educationally and dramatically (and of course both those two outcomes are inextricably linked). </p>

<p>There are all sorts of strategies and they are connected really to accessing the Christmas story as any story. You could try a teacher-in-role drama, for example, as a shepherd who is scared by what he saw in the sky last night and could the children help explain what it meant. Or you could be an innkeeper and you don't know what to do about these poor people at your door who want a place to stay. You can take a range of roles from the story. Herod is an interesting character, and as the king you can ask for all sorts of advice about what to do about this new king born in your kingdom. What about Joseph who is unsure of whether he should marry Mary because everyone is talking about her being pregnant and going to the students as counsellors who help you make a decision as to what to do. </p>

<p>The traditional Christmas retelling complete with tea towels etcetera doesn't work educationally or artistically particularly well because you are asking the kids to retell the story. There is an old saying in educational drama that says "Drama is not stories retold in action". There is little creative learning happening in acting out the Christmas or any story. The key bit is to use the conventions to find ways into the drama. </p>

<p>How about then a series of tableaux about what the kids see as the most important parts of the first Christmas story or their own Christmas story. You can do thousands of things with the tableau that you know about like, tap for thoughts, make one line at a time, make it bigger or smaller, change the focus, add something that changes its meaning, build a small improvisation from it to another still image. </p>

<p>How about a role on the wall of Joseph or Mary or one of the wise Kings? 
How about hot-seating Herod and asking him why he ordered all those children to be killed? How about Christmas in the year 3000 and interviewing the teacher in role about that? What if, in the drama, you meet someone in role who hates Christmas (a scrooge-like character) and you have to present three images of what Christmas can be like to convince him that Christmas is a good thing? It would make a really good lead into teaching or reading <i>A Christmas Carol</i>. </p>

<p>With all these activities there are wonderful opportunities for singing and music-making with carols. How about someone who needs another verse for <i>Silent Night</i>, or needs it illustrated for their new book on old carols? What about new carols? </p>

<p><b>Phil:</b><br> 
Thanks for these great ideas and strategies that I can try.  I can see from your reply that I need to be a bit more creative in the way I approach the end of year. I can now see a lot more possibilities. It looks like we are going to have a lot more fun this year and any one of these strategies would help involve all the children. Thanks, you have given me so much to think about.</p>

<p><b>Jeanette:</b><br> 
What drama process would you suggest to use with our children to increase awareness and sensitivity of differences and similarities when interacting with severely disabled children? (This follows a visit from a class of severely disabled children from Blomfield School).</p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b><br> 
Hi Jeanette, what an excellent and difficult question. One of the best process dramas I have seen that deals with the issues you talk about is in the Norah Morgan and Julianna Saxton book <i>Drama &#8211; a mind of many wonders</i>. It describes a process where kids talk first about accidents and then through a series of drama conventions trace the story of a family who have some one seriously injured in an accident. They are confronted with making a range of decisions about what they should now do as a result of the accident. 
I would never use drama to have kids acting out or pretending what its like to be severely handicapped.</p>

<p><b>Sue Cheesman:</b><br> 
Welcome to our forum and it is great that you have already given a wealth of information for us to use. How do you incorporate drama games into lessons or are they an end in themselves?</p>

<p>Can you suggest for us some activities or approaches with a focus on New Year and new beginnings, maybe in relation to years 7 and 8?</p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b><br> 
Hi Sue. There are two parts to your question.  I'm not a great fan of drama games and yet I know lots of experienced drama teachers who swear by them. A couple of things about games: first, rather than warming kids up they some times distract and hype kids up and it's really hard to then move them into more serious work. Secondly, kids then think that drama games are all there is to drama and they want to stay at that level rather than push themselves, and so sometimes it's easier for the teacher to let them stay there. Thirdly, sometimes kids don't need warming up, they need instead to calm down for drama, so I guess it's about the judicious and thoughtful use of games rather than starting every lesson with a game.</p> 

<p>I'm keen, where I can, to use process drama to build game-like structures into the work we are doing. I'm all for context with everything, so I cringe a little when I see lesson plans which start with games, as they presuppose a lot of things that aren't necessarily valid. </p>

<p>To address your second point about New Year drama, I guess for me it's about working with kids at that level perhaps on their own stories of what happens on New Years Eve. They might start then by sharing stories about what they do in their own home. They might then work through some improvisation tasks to present the night. I'd work with them to present non-naturalistically, in other words, using the conventions; so I might say "let's see the night using flash back and chorus" or maybe silently negotiate some script, linking three frozen images. </p>

<p>Teacher-in-role dramas at this level might involve someone who has stolen the time and the children might go and find the thief, in-role as detectives. It would make for some fascinating discussions about time and what it means etc.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Lucy: </b><br>
I have children from different cultures in my primary class and one of them comes from China. I see in the newsletter that you have recently visited Hong Kong. Were you able to get a gauge on the main differences between the Chinese and New Zealander's approach to drama while you were there? </p>

<p>I would like to give my student, Shihau, an opportunity to use his Chinese knowledge of drama conventions in our end of year activities. Have you any suggestions for how I could do this? </p>

<b>Peter O'Connor:</b><br> 
Hi Lucy. Yes I met with the Hong Kong arts centre whilst I was there and we had a fascinating discussing about the differences and similarities between our two countries and how we approach and see drama. They are about to launch a drama curriculum, which is one of the reasons I was up there. </P>

<p>We talked at some length about the identity issues in Hong Kong and how, when they set up the curriculum, they will need to make sure they include Chinese conventions and forms into the curriculum. The really interesting thing was that the group I met with were largely educated in the British system and so didn't know the indigenous forms and conventions particularly well themselves. I guess there were resonances for me in terms of my own understandings of M&#257;ori conventions and forms.</p> 

<p>Regardless, whilst in Hong Kong I was struck by the use of mask and puppets in Chinese theatre and also the use of dance and ritualised movement to tell stories and I would imagine that your student may or may not be aware of these forms depending on her education and upbringing in Hong Kong.</p> 

<p>The Hong Kong people also see the importance in their post-colonial state of using drama in education as a means of strengthening Hong Kong people's identity as Hong Kongese.</p> 

<p>If your student doesn't know the forms and conventions she can certainly share her stories of Christmas in her homeland and that can be structured through a range of conventions. Hot-seating is a start I guess, or a journey drama where, in-role, the students explain what they are about to see as they arrive in different places at Christmas time (you can but don't have to show anything, easiest is frozen images rather than actual improvisations).  A neat way to do it though is to have a cast of actors ready who have to respond to the student as she calls out the directions. For example she might say: "Here you see two people walking slowly with their birds in the park".  The students get up and improvise as she adds more and more instructions to tell the story of Christmas in her own country.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Lucy:</b><br> 
Thanks Peter. I'll introduce masks as a starter. I think that we could have a really great discussion with the students on the various roles of our nativity characters, then develop appropriate masks to work with. It'll also give us a great opportunity to look at some Chinese drama conventions too. I'm also interested in improvisation techniques too, so will explore that later. </p>

<p>Have you any suggestions of resources that I could explore in regards to drama or mask techniques?</p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor: </b><br>
There are some mask activities in the new <a href="../events/new_e.html#drama"><i>Dramathemes</i></a> book produced by User Friendly Resources, geared at primary level. Good book with all sorts of ideas and things in it.</p>

<p><b>Sue Cheesman:</b><br> 
Thanks for those ideas. I was also thinking that with year 8 it is about change, leaving one school to go on to the next, and new beginnings.</p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b><br> 
Yes Sue, so there are all sorts of opportunities to do dramas about reflecting on the year that they have just had with you. What moments do they remember best and think about what how they might present that dramatically. Then there are all the dramas that they can do about their dreams for the future. Hot-seat in 10 years time, in 20 years time, in 50 years time, etcetera. What about a role-on-the-wall of them on their first day at their new school?</p>

<p><b>Sue Cheesman: </b><br> 
I realise that many of our schools are involved in end of year celebrations before Christmas, and for some, drama is a very new discipline. Do you have any suggestions of "ways in" to drama learning at this time in the term, that have the potential to mushroom next year?</p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b><br> 
In primary I always think the <i>Big Book</i>, if you're using it, is a great way in. The story provides all sorts of possibilities and opportunities. There's also all the excitement and tension about waiting for Christmas which can be harnessed in all sorts of ways. A teacher-in-role as a child who is going to try and trick Santa into leaving her two lots of presents and talking to her friends (the students-in-role) is a fun way in. What about teacher-as-Santa who needs all his elves and helpers to sort things out for Christmas night, or a forgetful Santa who needs his helpers to write down the instructions to some children's houses (excellent cross-curricular task). Or a Santa who wants a new suit because he's tired of the red one. 
What about a teacher-in-role that is someone who didn't get anything for Christmas and is really sad.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><b>Bridget:</b><br> 
Hi Peter, Val and Sue, some wonderful suggestions, that have given me food for thought. However, I'm fast running out of time with our Christmas show next week and only one spare day to rehearse the show. I've only seven students and four are already doing something individually. It's the other three (ages 5, 6, and 7) whom I would like to give the opportunity to do something individually.
There is a kiwi theme with a huge mural of a pohutukawa tree and beach, etcetera. Intro song <i>Aotearoa</i> with the children dressed from different nationalities. Two children are the narrators; one plays the keyboard <i>O Christmas tree</i>, another sings <i>Silent Night</i>. They also retell the story of Santa Claus with dialogue related to today, for example, McDonalds, hairdresser, movies, etcetera. There is also a bit of interaction with the audience and puppets. 
Problem: I would dearly love for these three children to be given the opportunity to shine as individuals too, but I am a bit pressured as to what to do. It needs to be simple, perhaps a poem? Help? 
One child represents Hawaii, another France, and the third New Zealand.</p>

<p><b>Peter O'Connor:</b><br> 
Tricky situation Bridget.  Not all kids want to or need to have a starring role and some of them will be happy to take at this stage a less demanding role. You'll need to make the decision as the teacher if they need to be extended or are ready to be extended in presentation. </p>

<p>If you think they're ready then I'd give them something really simple to do. A two-line something that works is far more effective and gives them a better performance buzz than struggling over something really hard. </p>

<p>How about a little hula step for the Hawaii kid as she sings or talks "aloha from Hawaii", a painted moustache and a baguette and a "oui oui" from France, followed by a jandal-wearing Santa who gets to sum it all up at the end of the show as the kiwi Santa?</p>

<p><b>Bridget:</b><br> 
Thanks Peter. Reassurance that simple is best. I especially like the jandal Santa and will run it past the children tomorrow. I will be re-reading your comments and suggestions to the other users as well. Very, very helpful.</p>
