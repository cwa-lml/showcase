<h2 class="h2-forum">Merryn's Music Forum</h2>

<p><a href="index_e.html">Back to Archived Forum Discussion index</a></p>

<p>Excerpts from forum discussion with Merryn Dunmill (National Coordinator Music)<br>
31 July 2002</p>

<p>
<b>Val Duthie:</b><br> 
Kia ora, welcome to the first music forum for term three. We are returning to Chapter 1 of <i>'Into Music 1'</i> this week to discuss 'Listening' in more depth. We will be discussing: 	 
</p>

<ul>
<li>how to create an active listening environment </li> 
<li>how to gather formative assessment information.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>'The Hall of the Mountain King' by Grieg</i></p>

<p><b>Linda:</b><br>
I found the following sites:<br>
<a href="http://www.mnc.net/norway/EHG.htm" target="_blank">www.mnc.net/norway/EHG.htm</a>, an excerpt from The Hall of the Mountain King<br>
        <a href="http://www.troldhaugen.com/" target="_blank">www.troldhaugen.com/</a> 
        On this site, you can visit the home of Grieg. </p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b><br>
These sites are really useful in helping students to identify with the music as, on the first site, you can actually play the music and listen to an evocative passage about 'trolls' &#8211; great for mood and style. On the second site you find out information about the composer, his life, where he lived, etc. by selecting individual buildings from the Troldhaugen Museum.</p>

<p>Can you suggest ways (in addition to those on page 12 of <i>'Into Music 1'</i>) that we could use these sites when planning a listening programme based upon the music <i>'In the Hall of the Mountain King'</i> by Grieg?</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b><br>
I have used the music from <i>'The Hall of the Mountain King'</i> by Grieg as motivation for several very successful arts units. Being such an emotionally based story and piece of music, it immediately engaged the imagination of the children. In one unit, we danced, dramatised the story and created large and wonderfully elaborate masks as large as the children themselves. In another unit we focused on the music and immersed our creativity and imaginations in listening to the music, responding to the music, and making music. During these sessions, the children developed a useful and specific vocabulary for their own self-evaluations, which is a large part of formative assessment.</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b><br>
<i>'The Hall of the Mountain King'</i> &#8211; ever popular and never seems to go out of fashion. It is such a good example of the elements of music at their contrasting best all set in the drama of bad trolls, a king, a cave, etc.  Excellent creative motivational material!</p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b><br>

Below is an excerpt from this passage: <i>'The trolls can be hated, no matter what &#8211; it's their official role, due to the portrayals, let's guess. As it is, fantasy figures like demons and trolls have their roots and counterparts in tradition and myth.'</i><br>

<p><i>How do I create a supportive environment for students to express their views?</i></p>

<p><b>Phil:</b><br>
I am really interested in assessment and how to gather formative assessment information. I recognise that students need feedback about what they have and have not achieved as well as genuine praise. It's sometimes hard, however, to provide students with clear goals, and a clear idea of what these goals look like, while at the same time motivating them, yet not giving them too much praise. I'm encouraging my students to talk about what they are trying to learn. My first goal being to reach, with them, a shared understanding of what we are doing. What sort of strategies do you suggest that I put in place to ensure that these discussions are supportive and create a safe environment for students to express their views?</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b><br>
If we focus on listening today it will hopefully provide an assessment model for other music learning areas. Formative is, as we all know ongoing, observational, interactive, responsive and reflective. Our students need to be, as you point out, part of these processes, to own their learning, monitor their progress, set goals and challenges, and negotiate strategies to improve.  With listening, there are many aspects to consider in terms of monitoring student learning: e.g., <i>'The Hall of Mountain King'</i></p>

<ul>
<li>how well can they use the language of music/music vocabulary to identify and describe what they are hearing? e.g., <i>'there were more instruments playing as it went through and it got louder and faster and really exciting.'</i> The focus here shows this student's ability to focus on texture, dynamics and tempo. The teacher uses these key words/elements of music to consolidate (not praise) e.g., <i>'Yes, the dynamics got louder and tempo got faster.  Do you think that hearing more instruments play made this happen? What might be happening to make the music sound exciting? What instruments can you hear playing?'</i></li> 
<li>can the students find the beat to the music and maintain the beat as the tempo changes? Here repeated playing of the music are necessary with a range of approaches to keep up interest, e.g., patting knees, moving (from a curled up ball to a dancing troll! Jumping to the beat). </li>
<li>more advanced students may notice a pattern and be able to tap it back to you &#8211; the rhythmic ostinato/pattern that repeats over and over in this music. All students can learn this pattern and play on instruments.</li> 
</ul>

<p>Feedback to students at these process points should be motivating, e.g., "I noticed that we managed to remember the first part of the rhythm. How can we remember the whole pattern so that we can play it clearly with the music?" (You could for example, add names of people in the class, just a few, whose names match the rhythm such as Hana, Peter, Miriam, Miriam, Miriam Tessa, Sasha, Hone, Tusi, Maddy, Jason, Sue".</p>

<p>You could ask these questions: "When is it easy to keep the beat? When does it get harder to keep the beat? How might we move/play the beat to match the way it sounds on the stereo? </p>

<p>You could write the following summary on the board: </p>

<ul>
<li>What were the easy things to hear in today's music?</li> 
<li>What was harder to identify? e.g. instruments.</li>  
<li>Tomorrow's challenge is to listen again and see if anyone can hear something new in the music and share it with the class.</li>
<li>Research question: find out about some instruments that play in an orchestra.  
(To support this, you could gather some pictures, CD tracks and Internet live players into the school etc.)</li> 
</ul>

<p>The next assessment, i.e., the next orchestral piece of music listened to and discussed, will draw out the learning, and ongoing monitoring of learning is obvious with this new application. You are looking for students at this age to not only recognise (first formative stage) but to identify and describe sound across all the elements.</p>

<p>Take one element at a time as a focus and choose music that allows for this. TONE COLOUR: Tihore Mai for example has female voices, a karanga weka (M&257;ori flute), and poi.  
Ask questions such as: </p>

<ul>
<li>how are these used?</li>
<li>what effect do they have?</li>
<li>how are these instruments different to the orchestra?</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Phil:</b><br>
I really like the way you suggest a progression. That is, 1) <i>'On the board a summary of easy things to hear in today's music can be made and those that were harder to identify e.g. instruments'</i>. 2) <i>'Tomorrow's challenge is to listen again and see if anyone can hear something new in the music and share it with the class. A little research could be to find out some instruments that play in an orchestra, pictures, and CD tracks Internet live players into the school etc all help. The next assessment i.e., the next orchestral piece of music listened to and discussed will draw out the learning, and ongoing monitoring of learning is obvious with this new application'</i>.</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b><br>
To finish your question about listening to strategies Phil, the old "OK" to each response.</p>  

<p>Saying there is no right or wrong is a good explorative and provocative statement. If the answer is not on the right track then say 'let's listen again and see how we hear it this time, because as we listen again, we hear things differently, which is exciting. Put your listening ears on everyone and let's work out how we hear things this time.' Or simply, 'listen again and put your hand up if you hear something different this time.'</p>

<p>Be aware of peer pressure as stronger leaders dominate and unsure students simply follow. Another strategy when you can't entice shy students to contribute after all is to say, " Hands up if you agree as a group approach. Each group can have a card with an element on it, e.g., tempo/speed of the music, another will have dynamics etc. They all listen but for only one aspect. The group has a chat and comes up with a response for the class on what they heard after agreeing on their ideas to share. Eventually, after rotating around these 'stations' over a few pieces of music, confidence grows and individuals are better able to respond in a meaningful way. Listening/aural perception takes time and concentration, teacher guidance and focus, shared language and understandings. There is always room for difference of opinion to some degree, e.g., how it made you feel, or tricky instruments to identify.</p>

<p><b>Phil:</b><br>
So, what is really important is getting that first step underway, getting a common vocabulary and clear goals so that everyone knows what everyone else is talking about.</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b><br>
Thank you Phil for your succinct summary.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>National anthems</i></p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b>
I wonder if any of you have found new pieces recently that you have used in your listening programme? Perhaps they inspired some creative work, performance opportunities or attempts at 'transcribing' i.e. making a musical score from a section of what is heard such as graphic, pictorial or even conventional notation of a wee tune or rhythm idea. Perhaps the music you are listening to feeds into other learning &#8211; about other countries, places, people, rituals, languages, and events. I expect there is a lot of Commonwealth Games countries' anthems being heard too, which is a great way to start learning about the world.</p>

<p><b>Win:</b>
Yes, we found a website of national anthems and did some research about several of the countries from that. We asked the question 'what is the difference among these national songs?' and 'do the songs tells us something about the country?' We are finding out so much by asking these questions. The children are working in groups and will be telling the class their findings soon.</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b>
Others will take your ideas and do the same I am sure. I'm sure that there will be a wealth of wonderful teaching and resource materials that are evolving out of this, so topical and interesting. Great motivation to have a go at writing a new national anthem for Aotearoa too!</p>

<p><b>Sharon:</b>
Could you please post the address for the National Anthem website.</p>

<p><b>Win:</b><br>
<a href="http://www.aresearchguide.com/anthems.html" target="_blank">http://www.aresearchguide.com/anthems.html</a>. This is a great website. It's a research guide of students and includes MIDI recordings of anthems and colour illustrations of flags. You can find 193 countries on this site and select them from an A&#8211;Z list.

<p><i>What does 'sonorities' mean?</i></p>

<p><b>Carol:</b><br>
I have had a question put to me from a teacher in the South Island. She asks 'in the curriculum statement, page 61, it states: <i>'Listen to selected instruments and discuss their sonorities...'</i> When I looked in the glossary, I could not find the word sonorities. Can you help me?'</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b><br>
Re instrument sonorities &#8211; really why and how one instrument sounds different from another.  Just as we all look different to each other. Each sound source (not just conventional instruments either, e.g., electronic, environmental) has special qualities that make it unique.  Wood is different to metal and even within the wood, the actual type of wood makes a difference.  That's why Stradivarius violins were the world's best &#8211; the craftsman and his wood, the way he shaped each fragment of the instrument, the placement of its parts, the thickness and length of the strings and of the fingerboard etc.  The height of the bridge.  Ah, such architecture and technology and aesthetic pleasure all combining to make sound sources for the enjoyment of humans, plants and animals...and.....</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../../../../e/tki/img/back_2_top.gif" width="85" height="17" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Back to top"></a></p>

<p><i>Do you need experimentation or is questioning enough to produce an appreciation of quality in students?</i></p>

<p><b>Win:</b><br>
One of the many challenging aspects of formative assessment is developing children's 'nose for quality'. Does this occur through experimentation or is questioning enough?</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b><br>
I always encourage kids of all ages to reflect on their experimentation's and explorations &#8211; which sound did you like? Why? Where could you use this sound? After this type of questioning students begin reflecting critically on their own craft. Can you tell me about the sounds you are using/hearing? Talk about why you chose those.</p>  

<p>To be able to stand before your peers and describe music with confidence, without teacher prompting is an ultimate goal. As students develop the vocabulary and aural skills others can be encouraged, stimulated and educated by their peers. I think parents should have a music appreciation class with the children, so that they can listen to them talk about the way they hear. To be able to carry on conversations at home makes a healthy listening environment for all aspects of life.</p>

<p><i>Exemplars</i></p>

<p><b>Val Duthie:</b><br>
The exemplars on TKI provide some stunning examples of what Merryn has been talking about.</p>

<p><b>Merryn Dunmill:</b><br>
We have 8 professionally filmed and edited exemplars now and 2 more to make the 10 on the way. They will be ready for 2003 on CDROM, web, with 5 of them also coming out in hard copy (those that will work in this format only). I am also adding video footage to the learning examples on <i>Unwrapping the Arts</i> which will help too I hope.</p>
