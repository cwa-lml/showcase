      <p>Get the students to try out their new way of talking &#8211; they can work 
        in pairs and help each other. Discuss the different ways they might talk 
        to different people &#8211; their cousin whom they saw each weekend, their Auntie 
        whom they had never met before. Discuss what they might be doing while 
        they are talking &#8211; would they be sitting or standing, reading a book, 
        preparing food?</p>
