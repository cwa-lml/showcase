      <p><b>Tension </b></p>
      <p>The conversation needs to be set up with a purpose and the more tension 
        that can be introduced the more the students will have to work with. For 
        example, giving bad news, an argument about an issue, an understanding 
        barrier (language, ability, memory). It will be the tension that makes 
        the drama, makes it memorable for the students and hooks them in to the 
        learning. There are a variety of ways to add tension: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Time &#8211; put a time limit on the task; There are 10 minutes to convey 
          the information. The decision must be made in 10 minutes, as the plane 
          is leaving and the other person has to be on it. If they don't take 
          their medication soon they may become seriously ill. </li>
        <li> Competition for resources &#8211; If they take all the money there will 
          be none left for you. </li>
        <li> Life threatening situations for the characters.</li>
        <li> Risk for the environment.</li>
      </ul>
