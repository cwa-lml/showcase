      <p><b>Focus</b> </p>
      <p>Props can help with the focus &#8211; a large square of coloured cloth can 
        become many things, as can several sturdy black boxes (strong enough to 
        stand on, small enough to move easily). A dress-up box and a collection 
        of simple instruments can all assist with focus. Physically move students 
        into the places and shapes that you want them in. Tell them that they 
        have to remember where they are and what shape they are in and may have 
        to hold that position for some time (no balancing on one foot).</p>
