<h2>PLANNING AND ASSESSMENT</h2>





<h3>Key teaching and learning concepts</h3>

The elements of music:<br>

<br>

<b><a href="music_L5_A5_gloss.html#beat">Beat</a></b> &#8211; the pulse in music. <br>

<br>

<b><a href="music_L5_A5_gloss.html#rhy">Rhythm</a></b> &#8211; duration of notes forming patterns. <br>

<br>

<b><a href="music_L5_A5_gloss.html#pit">Pitch</a></b> &#8211; the degree of highness or lowness of a note. <br>

<br>

<b><a href="music_L5_A5_gloss.html#tem">Tempo</a></b> &#8211; the speed of the beat in music. <br>

<br>

<b><a href="music_L5_A5_gloss.html#dyn">Dynamics</a></b> &#8211; the varying levels of loudness and softness in music; or the signs 

used to indicate such levels.<br>



<br>

<b><a href="music_L5_A5_gloss.html#tone">Tone colour</a></b> &#8211; the specific tone or sound quality of a musical instrument, combination of instruments, or sound source (for example, singers from different cultural backgrounds have unique ways of using their vocal apparatus and therefore produce distinctive sounds); also called timbre. Sound sources include found, environmental, vocal, instrumental, and electronic sounds.  <br>

<br>

<b><a href="music_L5_A5_gloss.html#str">Structural devices </a></b> &#8211; these are devices used in constructing a piece of music and include a distinguishing idea such as riff, phrase, hook, sequence, repetition, variation and cadence.  The combination of elements also contributes to overall music structure (for example, harmony, texture). <br>

<br>

<b><a href="music_L5_A5_gloss.html#keyfeat">Key features </a></b> &#8211; those facets of a piece of music, that have a powerful and important musical effect. Different pieces of music will have different key features. Discovering key features helps to encourage an emotional and aesthetic engagement with a piece, rather than a technical description. <br>

<br>

<b><a href="music_L5_A5_gloss.html#soctex">Social text </a></b> &#8211; a musical work that refers to the society or culture in which it is created and that reflects the wairua/spirit (understandings, patterns of behaviour, practices, values, and symbol systems) within that society or culture. <br>

<br>











<h3>Prior learning</h3>



<p>Students need to have:</p>

 

<ul>

<li>listened to, and appraised, a wide range of music, especially M&#257;ori music;</li>

<br>

<br>

<li>completed a range of focused listening activities in which they have identified key musical features, including riff, phrase, hook, sequence, repetition, variation (rhythmic, melodic and/or harmonic) and cadence;</li>

<br>

<br>

<li>an understanding of elements and structural devices of music and how to use them in compositions to create structured pieces;</li> 

<br>

<br>

<li>discussed how the style of music may relate to social, historical or cultural contexts;</li> 

<br>

<br>

<li>fundamental skills in creating music for, and performing on, selected instruments (guitar or keyboard, percussion, bass) and the use of music technology, where appropriate, for example, use of sequencers, MIDI, music recording and editing equipment, audio software/hardware and peripherals;</li>

<br>

<br>

<li>an understanding that patterns and structures are used to build a piece of music;</li>

<br>

<br>

<li>the ability to play at least three chords on guitar and/or keyboard, to create and realise rhythmic ideas on percussion instruments and real or synthesised (keyboard) bass.</li>

</ul>



<h3>Possible specific learning outcomes</h3>

<ul>

<li>identify musical elements and structural devices in traditional and contemporary M&#257;ori music (PK);</li>

<br>

<br>

<li>explain the effect of musical elements and structural devices in relation to the music's intent and cultural context (UC);</li>

<br>

<br>

</ul>



<a name="ideas"></a>

<h3>Ideas for activities</h3>



 

<ul>

<li>Listen to, discuss, explore and perform a variety of haka, chants, and waiata.</li>

<br>

<br>

<li>Listen to the song &quot;Kotahitanga&quot; from the CD entitled <i>Oceania</i> by Hinewehi Mohi and also found on <i>Sweet!</i> CD resource pack provided to all New Zealand secondary schools by the Ministry of Education in 2002 (Track no.16) and view the video of the song on the <i>Sweet</i> CD-ROM. Discuss the use of any features (musical elements and structural devices used) of traditional M&#257;ori music that can be heard in this piece. Also consider the form of the music, how the different sections contrast in style, and use traditional art&#47;cultural forms and ideas. </li>

<br>

<br>

<li>Listen to the song again and comment on the contemporary features such as riff, phrase, hook, chords, and instrumentation evident in the music. Discuss how these work in with the traditional aspects.</li> 

<br>

<br>

<li>Learn the lyrics of &quot;Kotahitanga&quot; in te reo M&#257;ori (lyrics and translation found in the <i>Sweet!</i> CD resource book, page 48) and discuss the message of the song. Discuss how the message is communicated through the music.</li> 

<br>

<br>

<li>Consider male&#47;female roles and protocols in the sharing and production of music, for example, waiata, toi p&#363;oro, kapahaka, and in traditional M&#257;ori culture.</li>

<br>

<br>

<li>In small groups, devise and record a repetitive accompaniment pattern using two or three chords and involving percussion, a real or synthesized bass line to. Consider varying the chord pattern so that you have distinctive progressions for a verse and chorus. Add or layer a traditional haka, oro [sound], chant or waiata rangi [melody] that you know over the top of your recorded accompaniment. You may like to use this all through your created music or add a hook for variation. Make sure that you know and understand the reo and meaning of what you have layered. Share a performance of your piece with your peers and evaluate the success of it. Share your group's creative process with your peers, highlighting how you maintained or altered the musical and&#47;or literal meaning of the added haka, oro, chant or waiata rangi.</li>

<br>

<br>

<li>Listen to other tracks on the <i>Oceania</i> CD. Discuss the key features, functions, and effects of other tracks on the CD. What is different and what is similar? Using the CD sleeve notes, discuss the concept of the album. Is it M&#257;ori music? What is M&#257;ori music?</li>

<br>

<br>

<li>Compare &quot;Kotahitanga&quot; with the track &quot;He Kotahi&quot; from the CD entitled <i>Navigator</i> by Che Fu. Discuss how Che Fu features aspects of traditional M&#257;ori music. Both tracks talk of union and solidarity.</li>

<br>

<br>

<li>Learn about the performers who contributed to the <i>Oceania</i> CD.</li>

<br>

<br>

<li>Listen to, and research information about, traditional M&#257;ori instruments. Make instruments, compose for and perform on these instruments in appropriate contexts. Incorporate traditional taonga p&#363;oro into compositions and performances as appropriate.</li>



</ul>



<h3>Teaching tips </h3>



<p>As a teacher: </p>

<p> 

<ul>

<li>Listen to, read about and appreciate a wide range of contemporary and traditional M&#257;ori music by artists such as Upper Hutt Posse, Iwi, Moana and the Moahunters, Anika Moa, Herbs, Whirimako Black, Big Belly Woman, Dalvanius, Prince Tui Teka, Mahinaarangi Tocker, South Side of Bombay, Hirini Melbourne, Richard Nunns, Kiri Te Kanawa and many more.</li>

<br>

<br>

<li>Consult with knowledgeable leaders in your school and community, and  in your school and together, teach students traditional M&#257;ori haka and waiata. </li>

<br>

<br>

<li>Have students share ideas, in groups, and facilitate group tasks outlined in the <a href="#ideas">Ideas for activities</a>. Discussion points on traditional and contemporary features of &quot;Kotahitanga&quot; could encompass the following:

</li> 

<br>

<br>

<ul>

</p>

	<li>The use of traditional haka and taonga p&#363;oro, for example, koauau, puurerehua, body percussion, sounds that reflect the environment.</li>

	<br>

	<br>

	<li>Characteristic traditional and specific vocal range that centres the music around the reo.</li>

	<br>

	<br>

	<li>The female karanga-like use of the voice, used as a call of welcome and for all to come together in union.</li>

	<br>

	<br>

	<li>Use of contemporary and rock&#47;pop performance and recording techniques &#8211; rock instruments, pop song form, modal harmony, instrumental riffs, rock feel acquired through driving beat and syncopation with emphasis on beats two and four, bringing the haka voice forward in the mix in &quot;Kotahitanga&quot;, use of reverb and panning the intent and effect of the music on society in Aotearoa New Zealand and its place in world music.</li>



</ul>



<br>

<li>Seek out a range of different physical spaces for exploration and experimentation of the features and effects of M&#257;ori music so that students can reflect on the quality of their work</li>

<br>

<br>

<li>Facilitate the learning about traditional M&#257;ori instruments and share video, text, website and CD resources with students. </li>

<br>

<br>

<li>Tap into the community and consult local iwi and rangatira to find people who may be able to support M&#257;oritanga aspects of this work.</li>

<br>

<br>

<li>Explore school and community toi M&#257;ori connections and share understandings about toi p&#363;oro.</li>

<br>

<br>

<li>Provide ongoing opportunities for students to explore and discuss M&#257;ori music individually and in small groups.</li>

<br>

<br>

<li>Seek out a range of different physical spaces for sound experimentation so students can do quality listening to their own work.</li>

<br>

<br>



<li>Provide music technology, where appropriate, for example, use of sequencers, MIDI, music recording and editing equipment, audio software/hardware and peripherals and encourage students to help each other with the recording process.</li>

</ul>



<h3>Assessment approaches</h3>



<h3>Formative</h3>

 



<p>During learning ask the students the following questions so that their progress can be monitored in an ongoing way:</p>



<ul>

<li>How and when could the waiata be used or applied? What protocols do we need to observe?</li>

<br>

<br>

<li>What musical features stand out for you in this waiata? What is the key message expressed through this waiata? How do the musical features (elements and devices) of the waiata help to express the message?</li> 

<br>

<br>

<li>What chords have you chosen for your piece? How did you get the progression? How have you varied the progression for a contrasting section? Is there enough contrast between sections? What is the bass and percussion part doing? How do all parts work together? As well as variation between the chord progressions of each section, have you considered varying the riff, the rhythm pattern played by the percussion and the bass part, the pitch and/or tonal range of the sound sources?</li> 

<br>

<br>

<li>How could you combine or layer a haka, oro, chant or waiata rangi over the accompaniment? Have you thought about using a traditional taonga p&#363;oro or sample in your piece? What sort of idea would work with this accompaniment pattern &#8211; a fast or slow idea? A high-pitched or low-pitched idea? A smooth or jerky idea? A male or female voice? Does the chant or waiata need to be in a different key from the original to work with your chord progressions?</li>

<br>

<br>

<li>How does your new piece enhance the traditional feature(s) of M&#257;ori music that you have selected to incorporate? Is your piece musically convincing? Why &#47; why not? How would you go about this next time?</li>

<br>

<br>

<li>What have we learned about tikanga, kawa, wairua, ihi, wana, wehi of M&#257;ori music?</li>



</ul>





<p><i>Assessment task</i> </p>

<p>In groups, compose a brief structured piece that incorporates a feature(s) of M&#257;ori music.</p>

<p>After experimentation with M&#257;ori musical features in groups, the students compose a short structured piece (for example, introduction-verse-chorus (hook)-verse-chorus (hook)) that uses one or more feature(s) of  traditional M&#257;ori music discovered through listening and exploring. Aim to make the different sections of the piece fit together using elements and devices to achieve repetition and contrast. Record the piece or practise it to play it live. Have the class listen to the piece, then listen again while the groups explain how they put the piece together and what they learned about tikanga, kawa, wairua, ihi, wana and wehi from the experience.</p>

<p><i>Key questions</i> </p>

 

<ul>

<li>How has the group been able to incorporate feature(s) of M&#257;ori music into a structured piece of music built on three or four chords? How effective is the music? Is it M&#257;ori music?</li>

</ul>
