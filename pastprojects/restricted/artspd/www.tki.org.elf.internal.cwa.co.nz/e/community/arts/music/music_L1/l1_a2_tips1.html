Rhythm is easiest for students with voice, then with hands and body percussion, then with instruments, last with feet in locomotor or whole-body movement<br>

Play tapes with rhythmic music and have the class keep the <a href="#" onclick="opener.location.href='music_L1_A2_gloss.html#beat';window.close();">beat</a> with their fingers on their knees.  Suitable tapes are: Te Vaka, Mozart, Vivaldi's four seasons, Moana and the Moa-Hunters' Tahi
Make sure you can offer a range of sounds - practice!<br>

You may find it helpful to use a tape with a steady beat to keep everyone moving, or play a tambourine or a drum.<br>

Provide a range of untuned percussion sounds: light sticks, wood blocks, scrapers, metal sounds, drums of various kinds including homemade.<br>

Keep the rhythm going and move at a good pace to keep students energised.
Bring in the voice, try consonants (unvoiced):  P P T T/ P T K K<br>

Consider starting from a voice or chant <br>

Introduce tuned percussion only when everything else is explored fully.  Then consider glockenspiels, chime bars, xylophones, keyboards.<br>

If you have glockenspiels, consider using only the black notes to start with, which sound pleasant together, even when the entire class is responding at the same time with different patterns
